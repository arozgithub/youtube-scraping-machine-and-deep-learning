dntQi5oRuBc,Take Me to Nagaland | Web Series | TRAILER | North East India Travel Video | Tanya Khanijow,"WEB SERIES: Take Me To Nagaland 
Here's an ode to the beautiful state of Nagaland as we discover a little something about the culture, the tribes, the upcoming fashion designers, the pop culture and the FOOD (very important) of the North East Indian state of Nagaland! 

Accompanying me on this journey is Larissa Dsa, who has an impeccable style and spirit of adventure, and hence we will together discover the fashion and food secrets of Nagaland. Besides a perfect co-traveller, she is also a brilliant YouTuber and Photographer herself. You absolutely can't miss her work! :)

A second perfect addition to this trip is Namrata Menon, a very talented videographer/cinematographer. She and her work for me were and instant love and I can't recommend her enough for more video projects. Not only is she a talented girl, but also super fun to travel with. 

Our trio survived a 15 day worth of madness and exciting travel adventure and I cannot wait to share the whole series with you. The web series releases on 15th June, and is very different from my other travel series thus far. Stay tuned and hope this Trailer excites you!

t40hlvzEvwY,Can SpaceX Make Point-To-Point Space Travel Profitable?,"SpaceX and Blue Origin think point-to-point space travel will replace flights as the preferred means of passenger travel. A plane ride from New York City to Shanghai is about 15 hours - and it could be as long as 29 hours with connecting flights. With point-to-point travel, SpaceX says it could get you there in less than an hour. How realistic is this approach to long-haul travel?

As companies like Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin close in on offering trips to the edge of space, space tourism is becoming a possibility. But what if spaceships went farther ‚Äî and faster?

Point-to-point space travel has been touted as a business line by SpaceX, Elon Musk‚Äôs rocket and spacecraft company.

AD8vRDaJWPs,NAGALAND - DZUKOU VALLEY &amp; JAKHAMA  | Travelling in North-East India | Indian Travel vlogs,"Welcome To Nagaland! (3/3) DZUKOU VALLEY & JAKHAMA - The villages in Nagaland.

I visited Nagaland in the month of April and had the opportunity to open my mind to endless experiences! For the longest time, Nagaland and the whole of North East has been so neglected: tourism wise and also culturally :(. So I took the plunge to discover the beautiful state myself, with two other creators- Tanya Khanijow & Namrata Menon. These girls have been the most lovely to travel with :)
This is Part 2 of the Nagaland series #TakeMeToNagaland! there are 3 in total! please watch part 1 because it's super fun and features the cities - Dimapur & Kohima ( the capital of Nagaland)


üôèüôèThings to remember when you plan your travel:üôèüôè

üôèThe Visvema route (the one I took) is much easier compared to the Jakhama route. 

üôèYou can camp  the previous night at Campsite Yedika just like I did, before you trek to the valley.

üôèDrones are not allowed in the valley (we had special permissions to use them)

üôèYou can get in touch with @tirelessfoot_nicholas on Instagram, incase you're interested to trek to the valley. He's a good buddy, and will help you in the best way

üôèEntry to the valley is INR 20/- only

üôèCarry your sleeping bags and down jackets cuz it's super windy and extremely cold at night. I went in the month of April and it was super cold.

üôèThe best option would be to trek early in the morning and reach the dormitory by or before 2pm. 

üôèDO NOT trek to Dzukou without a local guide.


üôèYou need an ILP-(Inner Line Permit) to enter the state of Nagaland. You can apply here‚Äî  https://www.india.gov.in/application-... 

üôèCommute in the city is pretty straightforward. You can use the local rickshaws, or hire a car to go around. The roads are super bumpy especially in Dimapur & Kohima, so be prepared :D

üôèThe food scene is very much different than mainland. Vegetarians options are available, but make sure you mention you‚Äôre vegetarian since they also tend to cook their veggies in pork fat. Nagaland thrives on pork and beef, and a lot of things you don‚Äôt see in the rest of the country. I suggest that you visit with an open mind, else it will be super difficult to survive. I personally loved the food. :D

üôèMake sure you have enough cash on you. It‚Äôs advisable to carry cash from home since it was even hard to find ATMs. 

üôèHomestays are the best way to experience the local living. Since the people are super friendly, the hosts are lovely to interact with and know so many things about the Naga culture.

üôèDo a lot of research before you visit. The state has 16 different tribes and they speak different dialects. Read about their lifestyle and food. 

üôèCarry your rainwear and warm clothes since the weather is pretty unpredictable. The best time to travel according to me is December (for Hornbill festival ) and also April. 

üôèNagaland is a dry state! :P 

üôèNagaland is a state full of beauty and the nicest people I've ever come across. The misconceptions about this magic land are hilarious! So do not believe anything else you hear about this place. We stayed here for 10 days and had no issues, problems at all! Trust me! Your next travel, must be planned for the north-east especially NAGALANDDD! 


üíãAlso, thanks to Tanya and Namrata, for helping me film so many shots! 

This video, and the rest of the videos of the Nagaland series are in collaboration with Tanya Khanijow! and also in collaboration with the super talented cinematographer - Namrata Menon :* Love you my mungi :*

JRaakIL-N_s,Fiji Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Fiji.d6023598.Destination-Travel-Guides

The locals in Fiji have a saying, ‚ÄúBulla,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúgood health.‚Äù You‚Äôll hear it used frequently as a greeting when you arrive at the 330-strong islands that comprise this archipelago. You may even find yourself saying it before long!

Any Fiji tour will highlight its magnificent, unspoiled waters and lush landscapes. Go snorkeling, swimming, diving, and sailing on turquoise waters. If you‚Äôd rather stay on dry land, you can zipline through rainforests or explore the windy plains of the highland area. Travel to the interior and learn about traditional Fijian culture, or visit the capital city of Suva and wander through its colonial buildings, bazaars, and the quiet harbor. 

Two-thirds of the Fijian archipelago are uninhabited, and your Fiji sightseeing should include a stop at Denarau‚Äôs marina, where you can book a boat to take you to some of these pristine locations. From family-friendly islands to romantic getaways, you‚Äôll find something to your taste amongst these scattered isles.

R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,"Many people daydream about traveling the world, but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling ‚Äì hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book ‚Äú1000 Days of Spring‚Äù and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: http://tomislavperko.com/en/.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx",travel

N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/caribbean/cuba.d44

It‚Äôs only 93 miles from Florida, and just 13 from the Bahamas, but like the smoke that coils from its legendary cigars, The Republic of Cuba exists in a time and space all its own.
 
Few cities can stir the imagination like Cuba‚Äôs capital, Havana, a city preserved by forts, a five-mile seawall, and an imposed embargo, which held back the excesses of the 20th century for over 50 years.
  
Havana‚Äôs lure can be hard to resist, but Cuba offers so much more beyond the seductive lights of its capital. In Cuba, a long sandy beach is never far away. 
 
Just 12 miles from Havana‚Äôs downtown, the Eastern Beaches unroll toward the town of Matanzas, the birthplace of the rumba, and C√°rdenas, where the Cuban Flag flew for the very first time. From here, follow the scent of fresh lime, rum and suntan lotion north to Varadero. 
 
After exploring the northern coastline, turn south towards Cuba‚Äôs most revolutionary city, Santa Clara, and Trinidad, once the sugar capital of the world. Don‚Äôt miss elegant Cienfuegos, the only Cuban city founded by the French. 
 
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know whether Cuba is awakening to the world, or if the world is awakening to Cuba. Whatever your politics, it's easy to admire this island nation that has proudly gone its own way.
 
Cuba may still have one foot firmly in the past, but as the world tumbles towards tomorrow, we can be thankful for the many things it has not let go.",travel

vzSHcyXfNPw,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

We also paid a visit to the many dentists of Mumbai! Rob broke one of his teeth on the train to Mumbai so we went looking for a reputable dentist in Mumbai. We‚Äôve heard that getting dental work done in India is actually something foreigners pay to do since it is a lot cheaper than a lot of countries and also of very high quality. So really, we are in the best possible place to fix Rob's teeth!

73ulvWgcZKA,Should My Boyfriend and I Travel Alone? // Ask Pastor John,"Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together and stay in the same hotel? Should they? Pastor John gives three reasons why they shouldn‚Äôt.

Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together? Stay in the same hotel? Should they? It‚Äôs a question we get regularly. And this time from a young woman. ‚ÄúHello, Pastor John. My boyfriend and I plan to leave in three weeks for a trip we scheduled five months ago. My mother said she fears for us and for the temptations that could arise during the trip. I have assured her that while we have fallen into temptation in the past, we have desperately sought God and other Christian counsel to confront that pattern, and that we truly have laid it at the foot of the cross. After discussing this respectfully and in full, we concluded that all would be fine.

‚ÄúToday my mother again confronted me and tells me that she believes we are dishonoring God, even though we will be staying in separate rooms the entire week. While I am frustrated, I also do not want to dishonor my parents‚Äô wishes. I‚Äôm troubled in wondering if we are dishonoring God by traveling together before marriage.‚Äù

SR0wYcWX4Lg,RISHIKESH | STOPPED BY THE POLICE IN INDIA | BOLLYWOOD MOVIE SET! | INDIA TRAVEL VLOG,"In this vlog we're in Rishikesh, the yoga capital of India. But that's not why we're here. We're here to work, catch up with editing and just explore the area and that's exactly what this vlog is about.

This vlog is about us renting a motorbike and driving along the river Ganges where we unfortunately get stopped by the Police, and what we thought was a completely legal motorbike rental, turns out to be an illegally run operation. We also talk about and show you guys a Bollywood film set which we where lucky to witness on the banks of Mother Ganga.

Watch this video to see some colourful Bollywood dancing and find out how our unfortunate event unfolds.

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9h

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ

Q How do you work together with brands?

O9_QA69bz9M,INDIA LUXURY TRAVEL: CONRAD BENGALURU | TRAVEL VLOG IV,"India luxury travel to is truly underexplored. In this vlog I‚Äôm exploring the beautiful luxury hotel called Conrad Bengaluru. The Conrad hotel in Bangalore is one of the most beautiful luxury hotels in the city. For me it has been a dream property to review, ever since the Conrad Bengaluru opened it's doors a little over a year ago.

Especially as a foreigner it‚Äôs good to know India is not just a budget destination. You can find anything here as a foreigner tourist. It‚Äôs such a shame not to explore India luxury travel for a holiday.

I hope this video helps foreigner tourists when traveling India and inspires to include a luxury getaway, next to other adventures. More information on Conrad Bengaluru: https://bit.ly/2M02Gij

nPOO1Coe2DI,Dubai Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Dubai-Emirate.d1079.Destination-Travel-Guides

Come to Dubai, the ancient City of Gold, for your next vacation.

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city. Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania¬Æ, a ‚Äúcity‚Äù where children can roleplay various careers.

To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you‚Äôd like to try something a little different and don‚Äôt mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren‚Äôt staying there.

You can‚Äôt finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all. 

Visit our Dubai travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

Avengers: Endgame Timeline

So the movie opens three weeks after Thanos carried out the snap. The universe is devastated but after the surviving Avengers track him down and Thor finally goes for the head we pick up with them five years down the line, in 2023, which is where things start to get a bit confusing.

Due to the discovery of Time Travel, we start off with our heroes all in the same position at the Quantum Tunnel. They have split into groups, all with their own objectives and we initially follow Team A, made up of Captain America, Iron-Man, Ant-Man and Hulk.

This group travels to the Battle of New York to retrieve 3 infinity stones and split off into their own smaller groups. This is set during 2012 and it‚Äôs pretty much the moment that the entire infinity stone saga began with Thanos appearing in the post credits scene of The Avengers to kick everything off. However, things don‚Äôt play out exactly as expected and it‚Äôs at this point that Loki takes the tesseract and travels off to Disney + thus creating an alternate timeline.

Hulk and Ant-Man gain the Time and Mind Stone and together they travel back to 2023, however Tony and Cap still need to secure the tesseract and from here and thus they travel to the 1970s to secure the Tesseract. We will call this group Team AA and Hulk and Ant-man, Team AB. But what happened to the timeline they‚Äôd just left?

Well for now, that‚Äôs royally screwed up for the moment and at this point Thanos would probably still most of the stones, however he wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry out the snap so would probably just go planet to planet murdering people the old fashioned way.

In addition to this the timeline that they‚Äôve just left is slightly altered with the stones missing and though Tony managed to get some stuff off his chest, he‚Äôs still left this timeline very vulnerable.

Team B made up of War Machine, Nebula, Hawkeye and Black Widow then travel to 2014 during the events of Guardians of The Galaxy. This team then splits into Team BA and Team BB with Team BA, made up of War Machine and Nebula securing the power stone from Morag.

Rhodey returns back to the present with the power stone, but Nebula is kidnapped, and replaced with evil Nebula who is carrying out the bidding of Thanos. We will call this team, made up of Thanos‚Äô forces Team BC.

This timeline is really messed up now too. The events of Guardians Of The Galaxy do not happen as Quill is unable to get the Powerstone and the Gamora from this universe travels with Thanos to 2023 to fight the avengers, which I‚Äôll get into later.

On Vormir we join Team BB, Black Widow sacrifices herself in order for Hawkeye to gain the Soul Stone and he travels back to the present.

zjQGzUQe6zM,MAYAT SUPIR TRAVEL ACEH SINGKIL DITEMUKAN DI KAMPONG BULUH SEMA,"MAYAT SUPIR TRAVEL ACEH SINGKIL DITEMUKAN DI KAMPONG BULUH SEMA

Mayat laki-laki tanpa identitas yang ditemukan di pinggir jalan Desa Pangkalan Sulampi, Suro, Aceh Singkil, Selasa (4/6/2019) diduga bernama Safriadi, sopir rental yang hilang sejak tiga hari lalu.
Hal itu berdasarkan ciri-ciri jenazah yang dikenali keluarga.
Korban hilang kontak dengan keluarga sejak menjemput muatan menggunakan mobil Kijang Krista warna hitam BL 1356 RZ, ke kawasan perkebunan kelapa sawit Lembah Bhakti.
Keluarga sempat menyampaikan informasi hilangnya penduduk Sianjo-anjo, Gunung Meriah itu melalui media sosial facebook.
Penemuan mayat bermula ketika pengendara sepeda motor melintas berhenti jembatan mencium bau tak sedap. Setelah dilihat ternyata ada sosok jenazah yang telah membusuk. 
Kemudian datang warga lain yang melaporkan ke pihak Polsek Suro.
Informasi penemuan mayat tersebut kemudian menyebar, hingga aparat kepolisian beserta warga pun berdatangan.
Mayat itu kemudian dievakuasi menggunakan mobil ambulans ke RSUD Aceh Singkil, di Gunung Meriah.(*)",travel

yORJH5B4z1o,FAMILY of FOUR converts OFF-GRID VAN to travel the WORLD,"Get the Van Conversion Guide: http://bit.ly/GetVanGuide

We met up with Charlotte and Andre and their two children to check out how they made their incredible van conversion! 

Hire this van with Quirky Campers: https://goo.gl/c7TNqm

This van conversion has a few pretty innovative features including TWO double beds, wood burner, fixed sky light and a beautiful rustic design.

This off-grid van conversion has a solar kit to allow for being away from campsites (or to avoid paying to plug in!) and gives them everything they need to travel as a family.

It is so cool to see this adventurous family create a beautiful living space that allows them to chase their dreams of traveling the world together.

Check out my travel vlogs: https://goo.gl/NbHJ87

Over the past few years I've found myself averaging anywhere from 2-4 flights a month. That's more than the typical American. I am lucky that I get to create my own schedule, and skip off to a new adventure whenever I please- here are the 10 travel mistakes that I've made so that you are aware of them and don't make them. Some of these are rookie travel mistakes that may seem obvious, and some of these are more personal to my perspective on traveling and how to have a fulfilling trip. I hope these help you in your travels!

My Millennial Life Crisis was started 3 years ago when I was stuck in a rut creatively, career wise, and personally. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I wasn't happy with where I was living, and I didn't feel like I had much of a support system. That is how the Millennial Life Crisis series was born. It was a way for me to let go of my feelings and document my personal growth. Along the way I have found that a lot of you have related with this feeling, that is why I keep vlogging. From now on you can expect weekly Millennial Life Crisis episodes about my life, growing up, career growth, trying new things, friendships, relationships, family, and travels.",travel

Qu7NZ1rC1Ow,Liechtenstein (Europe) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Liechtenstein in Europe.
In the middle of the triangular border of Germany, Austria and Switzerland lies a treasure of the European Alps, the Principality of Liechtenstein.  Hardly anywhere else in Central Europe has experienced such a rapid transformation from a dreamy agrarian state into one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Bendern, part of the village of Gamprin, is one of eleven municipalities and lies to the south-west side of the Eschner Mountain.  The view glides across the foothills of the romantic Rhine Valley and up to the massive Swiss Schw√§g-Alp. The Schaedler ceramics workshop in Nendeln is one of the oldest commercial enterprises in Liechtenstein and features handmade works of art.  Since 1836, they have specialised in earthenware, exclusive ceramic art and tilted stoves. Schaan forms the border to the Oberland, a charming municipality with an attractive town centre.  A parish hall and provision of good restaurants reflect the success of the global companies that are located there. Liechtenstein Castle looms majestically above Vaduz, the capital.  Saint Florin is located on the edge of the old town it was built in 1868 in Neo-Gothic style and in 1997 officially dedicated as a cathedral.  From the Sareiser Joch there are several trails along the ridge such as the Princess Gina Route that traverses various mountains of the border triangle.  More than four hundred well marked hiking trails are offered throughout Liechtenstein, plus a hundred and sixty kilometres in the Alps. The Principality is a treasure trove of both landscape and culture with mountains, pastures, castles, fortresses and museums.  But Liechtenstein has also become a small, modern state with a vital and indelible focus on finance and industry, a tiny paradise that is also an important economic power.

iXGtx-hroKE,Working online and traveling the world - digital nomads | DW Documentary,"Working online whilst traveling the world sounds like a dream job for many people. But what exactly is a digital nomad? Pete and Supi live as digital nomads.

They travel the world permanently, work on the road and are always online. Their lives epitomize the digital revolution and how it is changing how we work live.

Many people dream of living and working on the road - a dream that has come true for Pete and Supi. Driven by a passion for travel, they set out to escape the dreary routine of everyday life. They want to achieve maximum self-fulfilment without big safety nets and full-cover insurance, in a nomadic world of adventure. Pete is a DJ, so parties and big cities are a defining part of his life, whereas Suparni aka Supi is the opposite; she‚Äôs looking for spirituality and awareness. The two show us the huge spectrum of opportunities that the world of the digital nomad has to offer. Despite their fundamental differences, they both earn their living by working remotely. The digital age has made this way of life possible: without the Internet, it would be almost unthinkable. But their lifestyle does have its limits, as is becoming especially evident to Suparni with her plans for parenthood. But it's hard to find someone you love who also loves the same sort of lifestyle, and the constant travel is a big obstacle.

6hhaoTNu2a4,Madeira Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Madeira-Island.d11326.Destination-Travel-Guides

Pushed by volcanic forces from the sea floor into the warm trade winds of the North Atlantic, are the dramatic cliffs of Madeira. Volcanic activity may have settled millennia ago, but the island‚Äôs rich soils and spring climate means Madeira explodes in lush vegetation all year round. 

Madeira‚Äôs capital, Funchal, was named after the wild fennel which once carpeted its hillsides. Walk streets paved with patterned stonework that evokes the spirit of Portuguese culture and pride. Explore centuries-old churches and homes, which have endured pirate raids, German U-boat attacks, and earthquakes. 

From Funchal, head west to Cabo Gir√£o, one of the world‚Äôs mightiest cliffs. You‚Äôll find colossal views just a fifteen-minute drive east of Funchal too. At Garajau, watch divers far below enjoying the undersea gardens of the marine reserve. 

Madeira‚Äôs ring road strings together coastal towns and beaches, each one a little different from the last. If you‚Äôre looking for the island‚Äôs sunniest spot, head to Ponta do Sol. If you‚Äôve got a sweet tooth, head to the old sugar town of Arco da Calheta and enjoy a honey cake. And if the rumbling sound of breakers is your idea of relaxation, spend a night or two at Paul do Mar.

Madeira‚Äôs northern coastline offers plenty of drama and adventure too. Feel the power of the Atlantic in the natural swimming pools of Porto Moniz. If you‚Äôre keen on hiking the levadas into the mist-covered interior, the town of Seixal makes an ideal base. 

Less than an hour‚Äôs drive from Funchal is Pico do Arieiro, Madeira‚Äôs third highest peak.
From here, experienced hikers can follow knife-edged trails to even higher peaks, the same peaks that guided Portuguese mariners to Madeira six centuries ago.",travel

MRI8ffYKA8c,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d178316.Destination-Travel-Guides

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

DEJx0CYrDHk,Rome Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"As legend has it, Rome, Italy, was founded by the twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, in 700 B.C. The former Caput Mundi, or Capital of the World, sits beneath Palatine Hill, where the ruins of its original incarnation are open for exploration.

No Rome tour is complete without stopping by the remains of the Temple of Saturn and Arch of Septimus, both located in the Roman Forum. Get in touch with your inner gladiator and stop by the Colosseum, a relic of Roman bloodsports and perhaps the most recognizable element of the city.

Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain to ensure you‚Äôll return to Rome one day; don‚Äôt toss in two coins unless you‚Äôre ready to fall in love with a Roman. Continue your Rome sightseeing in St. Peter‚Äôs Square, home of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica. The world‚Äôs largest church, designed by Michelangelo, is both a remarkable structure and a tribute to faith. You can look down from the famous dome to the Holy Square, which is usually filled with the faithful looking to obtain a blessing from the Pope. After this, it‚Äôs just a few steps to restaurants filled with Italian food. Forget coming back to Rome ‚Äì you‚Äôll never want to leave.

What‚Äôs your favorite memory of Rome?

QSwvg9Rv2EI,Chicago Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Chicago.d178248.Destination-Travel-Guides

Chicago, once a small trading post on Lake Michigan, has grown into one of the country‚Äôs most famous cities. Visit ‚ÄúThe Windy City‚Äù and chow down on deep dish pizza for a truly unique vacation experience.

Follow ‚ÄúThe Loop,‚Äù the city‚Äôs primary business district, and marvel at its array of high-rise buildings, consulates, and universities. Shopping and fine dining abound in this area. If you‚Äôve worn yourself out in the city proper, set a more sedate pace at the Riverwalk, a pedestrian path along the Chicago River, or visit the many museums and parks the city has to offer. You‚Äôll never believe you‚Äôre actually downtown when you walk through the Garfield Park Conservatory, and the Art Institute of Chicago will allow you to appreciate creative works from around the world.

No Chicago tour is complete without a mention of the nightlife, so close out your day at a jazz lounge and let the sweet sound of music carry you away. Visit our Chicago travel guide and plan your next vacation today.

1PGiixdhNVk,Portland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Portland.d178299.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Portland, Oregon, where you can experience the laid-back atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest amid beautiful natural surroundings.

A Portland tour is easily accomplished on foot; this city was designed for pedestrians, so you‚Äôll be able to get around quickly. As you stroll along, you‚Äôll find plenty of parks, fountains, and buildings old and new to explore. Be warned, this city is known for its sudden showers, so make sure you bring an umbrella to shield yourself until the sun makes a triumphant return.

If you like a good brew, you‚Äôre going to love Portland‚Äôs alter-ego, Beervana ‚Äì so named thanks to all the breweries located here. Wine snobs, don‚Äôt despair; you‚Äôll find plenty to drink (responsibly) in the Willamette Valley while you continue your Portland sightseeing. 

If you‚Äôre here with the kids ‚Äì or you just really love animals ‚Äì don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Oregon Zoo, home to eagles, bobcats, and a ton of other feathered, furry, and scaled critters. Travelers with children will also love the Portland Children‚Äôs Museum, where the little ones can learn from and play with interactive exhibits. 

Whether you‚Äôre here for the beautiful views or to responsibly sample the vintages in the valley, Portland has something for everyone. What are you going to do when you get there?

Visit our Portland travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

ka-ZgwCXKho,Venice Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Rising from the waters of Venice Lagoon is the Italian city of Venice, a city like no other.
Begin your visit in the central district of San Marco, and walk upon one of the world‚Äôs great squares, St Mark‚Äôs Square. The square is surrounded by some of the city‚Äôs finest jewels such as St Mark‚Äôs Basilica, St Mark‚Äôs Campanile and Doge‚Äôs Palace. 
 
Just outside stand the Columns of San Marco and San Teodoro. From here, journey along one of the world‚Äôs great aquatic thoroughfares, The Grand Canal. Glide past elegant palazzos; once the homes of wealthy merchants, today many of these palaces house important museums and galleries. 
 
Known as The City Of Bridges, Venice has hundreds to explore. The Accademia Bridge links the San Marco district to the Accademia Gallery, and offers some of the Grand Canal‚Äôs finest views. The oldest of the Grand Canal‚Äôs four crossings is the Rialto Bridge, which today still serves as the gateway to the Rialto Markets. The most famous of all is the Bridge of Sighs, which connects Doge‚Äôs Palace to the historic prison.
 
Venice is a city to get lost in, so put away your map and let her surprise you. Discover waterfront promenades of The Zattere and the sleepy canals and spacious piazzas of Castello. On the tiny island of Murano, glassmakers have been creating works of incredible delicacy and color for over 700 years. Further across the lagoon, the island of Burano is famed for its brightly colored houses and exquisite lace.
 
Venice has shone her light into the far corners of the world for over one and a half thousand years. Just remember, this city smiles upon those who linger. So stay for a few nights, or stay for a month, and savor every moment she has to offer.

KtuTa8N3GZk,Alaska Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Alaska.
Alaska is a country situated on the edge of the Arctic and dream destination for wildlife and nature lovers who answer to the call of the wild.  A land of bears, glaciers, pioneers and prospectors on the northern tip of the American continent. In Vancouver, Canada‚Äôs pearl of the Pacific Ocean, begins an extraordinary journey along the Alexander Archipelago in the Gulf Of Alaska, a charming capital with European flair.  In English Bay a giant metal crab guards the planetarium and by aquabus our journey travels across False Creek to Science World with its marvellous glass globe that contains a museum of modern art. Ketchikan is a small town located five hundred and twenty six nautical miles north of Vancouver and was founded by the Tlingit Indians.  In the 1880‚Äôs the town based its economy on salmon and timber but today relies upon tourism. Since 1900, Juneau has been the capital city of Alaska, the forty ninth state of the U.S.A.  In 1880, Joe Juneau, Richard Harris and their Tlingit Indian leader, Chief Kowee, discovered gold in Gold Creek and the gold rush began. Glacier Bay was completely covered by ice and glaciers around four thousand years ago during the Little Ice Age.  The ice melted and the ever-changing glaciers are today situated within the arms of the bay which stretches almost a hundred kilometres to the north. Barrow is the northernmost point of inhabited North America and five hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.  The living conditions in the arctic wastelands are extremely harsh and most of the year it is bone-chillingly cold. Even today the promise of untamed nature and boundless freedom attracts us to America‚Äôs final wilderness.  Alaska is full of wild extremes and stark contrasts, a fascinating land of pure adventure!

tVflvbwKdHU,Cancun Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Cancun.d179995.Destination-Travel-Guides

Surrounded by the warm waters of the Yucatan Peninsula, Cancun is famed for its sunshine, history, and wild nightlife. Come to this former Mexican fishing village turned resort town to join legions of fellow sun worshippers ‚Äì just don‚Äôt forget to pack sunscreen.

Your Cancun tour should stop at the Acuario Interactivo, where you can meet mariachi-singing dolphins and other friendly sealife. Explore the vast historical offerings of Cancun by heading to the Yucatan interior, where you‚Äôll find ancient Mayan cities available to tour. A day trip to Chichen Itza, one of the world‚Äôs Seven Modern Wonders, is another must. Wander through its ancient streets and take in the temples, an observatory, and even a sporting arena.

At sunset, your Cancun sightseeing will come to a dazzling conclusion amid the wild nightlife. Watch shows, go dancing, attend parties, and make sure you‚Äôve got your camera out.

XhHwGolzQmg,Hawaii&#39;s Big Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Hawaii.d180074.Destination-Travel-Guides

The ‚ÄúBig Island‚Äù of Hawaii is the largest of the Hawaiian Islands, and offers a fascinating and stunning array of beautiful scenery for you to explore.

Sightseeing on Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island means your days will be filled with natural wonders: wander around a lava field, stroll through a tropical rainforest, and take a dip in the warm waters of the Pacific. To get the most out of your Hawaii Big Island tour and to get an idea of what areas you‚Äôd like to see up close, we suggest renting a car and exploring Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island from behind the wheel. The Onomea Bay Scenic Drive, located along the Hamakua Coast, will take you past shimmering emerald rainforest and astonishing glimpses of the tranquil Pacific Ocean. It‚Äôs the perfect place to get some pictures and see what the beauty of Hawaii is really about.

No tour of Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island is complete without meeting the sea turtles of Kahalu‚Äôu Bay. Strap on your mask and snorkel, and swim around the warm, blue-green waters of the bay to get up close and personal with the turtles and thousands of other sea creatures. If hanging out with the sea life isn‚Äôt entirely your cup of tea, you can also try paddleboarding, jet skiing, or a variety of other watersports. Alternatively, you can spoil yourself in the time-honored indulgence of relaxing on the black lava sands, soaking up some of the legendary Hawaiian sunshine.

What will you do on Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island?

Visit our Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

nJNLnBCQMy0,Los Cabos Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"Check out all the points of interest we visited in this video:https://viewfinder.expedia.com/los-cabos/los-cabos-travel-video-amazing-itinerary-ideas-for-planning-a-trip


When ready, check out vacation packages to Los Cabos: https://www.expedia.com/Los-Cabos.d180032.Destination-Travel-Guides



A tale of two towns on the very edge of Baja California Sur, Los Cabos is synonymous with relaxation and recreation. But when the team at Expedia made the voyage here, they found more than just a beautiful vacation destination.
They uncovered new shores, geological monuments, and exciting experiences. They encountered a region with diverse and welcoming people, vibrant art culture, world-class cuisine, and of course, a thrilling nightlife. 

For a romantic secluded escape, consider the arty San Jose del Cabo, a cultural hub bursting with inspiring art, Spanish colonial architecture and sheltered shores. 

If you are chasing the fiesta, check in to a hotel in Cabo San Lucas. Every sunset brings a new party to the sands and the streets here, so don‚Äôt forget to pack your dancing shoes.

_EkO2ofPOXg,Jordan Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"Want to know what goes into creating one of the Expedia Vacation Travel Guide videos? Check out how we made Jordan here: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/video/jordan-video-behind-the-scenes/

https://www.expedia.com/Jordan.d90.Destination-Travel-Guides

The ancient Greeks knew Jordan‚Äôs capital, Amman, as Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Overlooking Amman is the Citadel, the city‚Äôs ancient core. Rising over the Citadel are the remaining pillars of the Temple of Hercules, a Roman temple that in its day dwarfed many in Ancient Rome.  

 

From Amman, journey north to Jerash, home to one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Italy. Then, continue north to Ajloun Castle, built to halt the Crusader armies as they rode down Jordan‚Äôs northern valley, hell-bent on Jerusalem.

 

Enter the gravel plains of the Eastern Desert and follow the Desert Castle Loop. For many, the highlight here is Qasr al-Azraq, where Lawrence of Arabia made his winter headquarters. 

 

Travel south to Madaba, famed for the Madaba Map, one of the earliest depictions of the Holy Lands. Continue south along the Kings Highway, which once took Arabs to Mecca, and Israelites to the Promised Land. 

 

Follow the hairpin road 1300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea. Float in the saline waters and cover yourself in the same mineral-rich muds Cleopatra once enjoyed. 

 

No visit to Jordan is complete without a visit to Petra. Emerge from the shadows of the Siq and gaze up at the Treasury, the greatest of all of Petra‚Äôs 500 tombs. Then continue south to explore the emptiness of Wadi Rum. 

 

From epic landscapes to monumental ruins, Jordan allows us to reach out and touch the eternal, and be at one with something far greater than ourselves.",travel

We are ready to help to make your travel more comfortable. Follow our tips and you will know the best travel tips that will ease your life.

Store your phone and money safely in an empty sunscreen bottle while relaxing on the beach. Clean and dry the bottle and put your things inside.

Things everyone does on snapchat they don't want to admit!
First, everyone uses filters when they aren't looking their best. Whether you just woke up or are having a bad hair day, snapchat filters will cover it all! Next, we've all looked into getting surgery to look like that snapchat dog right...? oh just me? Just kidding, I really hope no one has done that. Third, we've all redone a ""candid looking"" snapchat because we didn't like the angle, how our hair looked, etc.

0ohZyqgIyQI,India (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 42.161 Hotels in India - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2EaPS2P

Travel video about destination India.
India is a subcontinent with a long history, a land of legend, fantasy and reality.A country that extends from the Himalayas in the north to the semi-desert terrain and tropics of the south. A place of incredible contrasts and fascinating splendour. Delhi is the political and administrative capital of India and a melting pot of both culture and religion. A constantly expanding metropolis built on the site of twelve former cities and centre of power for almost a thousand years. Jama Masjid, the Friday Mosque, is one of ancient Delhi‚Äôs main landmarks that was bequeathed to the city by the mogul king, Shah Jahan and close to the mosque is the bazaar district of Chandni Chowk, a busy commercial area. The white temples of Ranakpur are the sanctuaries of the Jains and are situated in a picturesque valley to the west of the Aravalli Mountains north of Udaipur. At around the same time that Buddhism was introduced to the area, Jainism also arrived, the religion of the country‚Äôs great hero, Mahavira. Rajasthan is the Land Of The Maharajas in all its splendour, a living fairytale beneath the desert sky. Agra was once the imposing metropolis of the mogul monarchy and today the city has lost nothing of its mediaeval atmosphere. Calcutta, or Kolkata, as it has been known since 2001, is the capital of West Bengal and also the second largest city in India. A city of contrasts that could not be more striking. Each morning hundreds of people go to the Howrah Bridge to bathe on the banks of the Hooghly River, a tributary of the sacred River Ganges. In 1853 Bombay had its first railroad and the Indian rail network was soon extended. The Victoria Terminus was built, one of the most impressive train stations in the world. Incredible India, a remarkable country that has always fascinated travellers by the amazing diversity of its people, culture and landscapes.

a4d5CbK0b3A,Vancouver Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vancouver.d178315.Destination-Travel-Guides

Vancouver‚Äôs breezes carry the scents of nature and aromas of all the urban delights you‚Äôd expect from a city regularly voted, ‚Äúthe Worlds most livable‚Äù.
 
The city takes its name from the British navigator who landed here in 1792.  The original settlement was called ‚ÄúGastown‚Äù, in honor of Gassy Jack, who built the city‚Äôs first tavern. Gassy Jack and his makeshift pub may be long gone, but in the historic neighborhood of Gastown, his spirit lingers on.
 
Vancouver‚Äôs early history continues at Waterfront Station, the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway‚Äôs construction brought Chinese workers by the thousands, whose descendants have enriched Vancouver ever since. Experience this interweaving of cultures in Chinatown, where the fusing of Oriental flavors with local seafood has helped earn the city the title, ‚Äúthe Culinary Capital of Canada.‚Äù
 
After visiting Vancouver‚Äôs central highlights, ride the ferry to Granville Island. Stock up on provisions at the Granville Island Public Market and sample craft ales at Granville Island Brewing. From Granville Island, head to Queen Elizabeth Park on Little Mountain, a peaceful oasis high above the city.
 
When it‚Äôs time to answer the call of the wild, cross the Lions Gate Bridge to The North Shore, a wilderness where bears roam and salmon-filled rivers flow through old-growth forests.  Less than a two-hour drive from the city is Whistler Blackcomb Resort, the largest ski resort in North America. The beautifully connected runs here cater to all skill levels and attract elite skiers and beginners from all over the globe.",travel

Oz is full of incredible things to see and do - from sailing around the Whitsundays Islands or taking a 4x4 around Fraser Island to surfing in Byron Bay and snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef.

But how much does everything cost in Australia and how much will you need to budget for a month on Australias East Coast?

I run through all the major things you'll need to budget for in Australia - including food, drink, accommodation, transport and all the major trips and tours.

Hopefully it'll help you be more prepared and help make sure you budget enough for your stay in Australia!

72__Mdioty8,Hong Kong Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Hong-Kong.d178263.Destination-Travel-Guides

Hong Kong, a former British territory, is one of the most densely populated places in China and in the world. You‚Äôll find quiet neighborhoods full of temples and a dazzling skyline loaded with shopping and dining opportunities.

Your Hong Kong tour must include visits to the many religious sites scattered around the city, where incense wafts from shrines and monasteries take over entire hillsides. You‚Äôll have a marvelous time shopping in tax-free Hong Kong, where you‚Äôll be able to find clothing, jewelry, furniture, and everything else under the sun. 

Don‚Äôt forget about Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, which overlooks the stunning Victoria Harbor. From there, your Hong Kong sightseeing may detour to Central, the city‚Äôs main business district, which looks like something out of a sci-fi film. The observation deck atop the International Commerce Centre will show you fantastic views of the city.

Hong Kong isn‚Äôt all cityscape, of course; there are many gardens, parks, and other green spaces for you to explore. You‚Äôll also find beaches, national parks, and quiet islands for you to indulge in natural beauty and serenity. This city truly has everything.

Visit our Hong Kong travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

rGKf1NhtJ1o,Queenstown Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Queenstown.d180018.Destination-Travel-Guides

Queenstown, in New Zealand‚Äôs South Island, is the gateway to stunning fiords, glaciers, ski fields and vineyards. This lake-side city provides the pulse that keeps this remote corner of the world energetic and youthful. As the descendants of fierce Polynesian warriors and determined European settlers, the Kiwis have the spirit of adventure running though their veins. 

Experience the beauty of Lake Wakatipu aboard the TSS Earnslaw. Nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Lady of the Lake‚Äù, for over 100 years this steamship hasn‚Äôt missed a beat, transporting livestock and passengers to and from the High Country. Back in Queenstown, soak up the Aotearoa sunshine on a sandy beach or in Queenstown Gardens. For a bird‚Äôs-eye view, ride the Skyline gondola to Bob‚Äôs Peak. Then when the sun gets low, head to Marine Parade and enjoy Mother Nature‚Äôs spectacle with kindred spirits from all over the world. 

Queenstown expands and contracts with the rhythm of the seasons. After the hectic summer, the town transforms into a world-class ski destination. Queenstown has three main ski fields; The Remarkables Ski Field, Cardrona Alpine Resort and the Coronet Peak Ski Area.

When the snow melts, Queenstown transforms again to accommodate visitors who flock to the Arrow Basin to explore its charming historic towns. The Kiwis know when it‚Äôs time to slow down, unwind and enjoy the finer things in life. Queenstown and the nearby Gibbston Valley are home to over 75 wineries, where vintners produce pinot noirs acclaimed for their purity, freshness and vitality, a perfect reflection of the region itself!",travel

AlCqyZEXM1I,Travel More &amp; Buy Less. | Luis Vargas | TEDxPortland,"We live in a world of consumption. Before you buy your next item for your ""man cave"" or ""she shed,"" think again. Adventure and exploration is the best way to learn and expand your horizons. The idea here is simple and enlightening, that one should have a passport full of stamps rather than a house full of stuff. Travel more. Buy less. #GO

With special thanks to the UNIVERSITY OF OREGON for presenting partnership, a world class stage design provided by HENRY V, an incredible legacy bound book provided by PREMIER and to the creative digital craft provided by ENJOY THE WEATHER. All of our Partners and event history can be found TEDxPortland.com 

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)

Luis was born in Mexico City, grew up in California and found home in Oregon. He has spent 20 years working around the World in the digital start-up and adventure travel space helping iconic brands like Disney, REI, and The Clymb create meaningful experiences-based businesses.

This is the second relaxing Psychedelic/Space Rock mix I've made. The first one https://youtu.be/iuWa5wh8lG0 was released about a year ago and it got insanely popular, clocking in at 3 million views at the time I'm writing this! 

This mix is pretty much the same but with others tracks and pictures. Some artists makes a well deserved return but there are also new ones in the mix.

You'll find the tracklist, timestamps and links to each artist below in the description and in the first comment under the video. You will also find links to every picture I used in the video in the pinned comment below. Please give the musicians your support if you find anything you like in the video. My last space rock video has really helped a bunch of bands to sell records and it was all thanks to you guys!

5g_7ODyxYQM,Pack with Me! | Packing Cosmetics for Air Travel in a Carry On | This or That,"NOTE: I have TSA Precheck and have never had issues traveling with this bag. If you do not have expedited security clearance, I recommend packing your liquids, gels, and creams in a quart sized clear bag. Most makeup is fine to pack separately just like what is represented in this video. If this is not how you like to pack, that is totally fine! This has worked perfectly fine for me the past 3 years that I've had Precheck. :) 

I recently took a 10 day international vacation to Italy! Join me as I pack my favorite cosmetics travel case that was packed into my AWAY Bigger Carry On suitcase and my small cosmetics bag to keep with me for quick access on the plane. You don't want to be caught unprepared for a long, overnight, international flight! Need some help packing? I got you! 

International Packing Companion Video is HERE:

*The one I have a was a collaboration with Sophia Joy and Target and was limited edition. There are a million just like it, though! I highly recommend the ones with a zippered mesh pocket, a covered area for brushes, and a large storage compartment on the bottom. The structure is perfect!

wW2y79D-9vk,Brunei (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 7 Hotels in Brunei - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2DEK6VA

Travel video about destination Brunei.
Brunei Darussalam is a tiny sultanate in the north of the island of Borneo located on the shores of the South China Sea and is surrounded by the Malayan federal states of Sabah and Sarawak. The capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, is like something from an exotic fantasy.

The splendour of the mosque of Sultan Omar Ali Saiffudin is a captivating sight. This Islamic landmark is also a symbol of great wealth and was built in 1958 and was named after the father of the present sultan. Snow white Italian Carrara marble was used as building material, with granite from Shanghai. It commemorates the founder of modern Brunei.

On a classic longboat powered by outboard motor, we travel on the Brunei River and are soon surrounded by mangrove brush. Tropical thunderstorms and monsoon rain create dense vegetation and the ensuing humidity produces lush flora.

At the junction of two muddy-grey waterways of the Brunei River is an historic location, Kampung Ayer, a water village. Each building and adjoining pathway is built on posts yet there is both an electricity and drinking water supply. Plants decorate the terraces, and TV aerials are everywhere and it has a population of around thirty thousand.

Brunei is a land that has almost lost its history while moving into modern times. It is a country that has grown amazingly wealthy since its gas has hissed and its oil has spluttered from deep below the ground. Liquid gold - Allah be praised!

wuwEFQuYOUo,Hong Kong Travel Tips: 11 Things to Know Before You Go,"11 things YOU need to know before you go to Hong Kong. A comprehensive travel guide to bring you up to speed on the Weather, Language, Getting Around, and more! Hong Kong was originally a British Colony founded in 1842, taken over by China in 1997. Hong Kong‚Äôs Official Name is the ‚ÄúSpecial Administrative Region of Hong Kong.‚Äù In Chinese Hong Kong Means ‚ÄúFragrant Harbor.‚Äù Hong Kong is Famous for Skyscrapers (it has 8,000 of them), but 40% of it‚Äôs land is park and nature preserve
Hong Kong has 3 main areas, Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories
But in total it has 263 islands

2 - Weather
Hong Kong's climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius in winter and exceeding 31 degrees Celsius in summer
Pretty humid all year round
May to November is typhoon season
June & August are the wettest
January and December are the dryest

3. Getting In
Likely flying in to Hong Kong International Airport - HKG.
 
It‚Äôs on Lantau Island, and its HUGE!  The size of 20 soccer fields.
 
You can fly to almost anywhere in the world from Hong Kong (more than 100 airlines operate 1,100 daily flights to and from 190 destinations worldwide) 
 
Cathay Pacific is Hong Kong‚Äôs home airline and has won ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Airline‚Äù four times ‚Äì more than any other.

Airport Express train to Central - Its just 24 minutes, and leaves every 10 minutes
You can buy a round trip airport Express and Octopus card for 3 days unlimited MTR for $350

Taxi one way to Hong Kong Island would be about $400 HKD and take 45 mins to an hour

4. Unlucky
This number omitted because it‚Äôs unlucky.  4 in Chinese sounds like the word for ‚ÄúDeath.‚Äù  Most buildings typically omit this floor.


5. Getting Around
By public transit‚Äîit's efficient, clean, and affordable
First things first, buy an Octopus Card -- It works on almost everything, even to get you in to the Hong Kong Horse Racetrack
MTT - Subway
Star Ferry - About $3 HKD, Upper Deck & Weekends cost a bit more.
Tram - Ding Ding - $2.60
Double Decker Bus
Mini Bus
Taxi - Relatively inexpensive, but can be hard to hail during rush hour, or a rainy day, or shift change between 3-4pm.
Don‚Äôt try to hail a cab if you see double yellow lines by the curb. Taxis can only stop if there is a single line‚Äîor none at all.
Uber


6. Money
Hong Kong Dollar
Exchange Rate fixed to the USD.  1 USD = HK$7.75‚Äì7.85
Most places take Visa/Mastercard
40% take AMEX
Lots of ATMS -- Hong Kong is a huge financial center after all
Bills: Issued by 3 different banks, so you‚Äôll see 3 different designs for all the bills
HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000
Coins: 


7. Language
2 Official Languages
1.Chinese, (Spoken Cantonese)
2. English
 
In the major urban districts, most residents will speak English but Cantonese is the local language
 
If you think you‚Äôre planning to learn a little Cantonese before you go‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not easy‚Ä¶ it has nine tones.

8. Shopping

Shops often stay open late‚Ä¶ none of this European 6pm closing time‚Ä¶ think 9 or 10pm closing times for most shops and malls

9. Food:

Cantonese Food
And it‚Äôs all about sharing, portions are big and made for big groups
Dim sum originated here in southern China and means ‚Äútouch the heart‚Äù. These tiny bites of goodness were created as snack food for travellers and today are an essential part of local culture.
Dim Sum
Hong Kong Milk Tea

Dai Pai Dong, Fast Food Noodle Shops, are common sites in Hong Kong offering an inexpensive bowl of noodles for around HK$20 and free tea

 Bones -- yes, lots of the local food has bones it.  At the casual restaurants you can just put the bones on the table.  At a fancier restaurant use the saucer plate beneath your bowl

Tea -- Need a refill for your teapot?  Turn the lid upside down.

Like to avoid the crowds?  Then avoid eating lunch between 1-2pm, that‚Äôs the typical Hong Kong lunch hour

10. Feng Shui
The mystical art of feng shui is still common practice in Hong Kong -- wondering why a building‚Äôs architecture looks weird?  The answer usually has to do with Feng Shui‚Ä¶ that might be why your hotel lobby has a water feature and some goldfish in it too!

11. I‚Äôve got more videos!

Ready for an adventure? Click play on our travel guide video to uncover some of the best things to do in Syndey, Australia. 

Established in 1788 as a penal colony, Sydney was once a little rough around the edges, but it has since transformed into a must-visit coastal destination. Today, tourists flock to this city on the east coast of Australia for its pristine beaches, coves, and harbors. 

During your romp around the scenic coastline, make a stop at the Syndey Opera House and eye its magnificent architectural design. Looking for a little more adventure? Venture over to the Syndey Harbour Bridge, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Coathanger,‚Äù and brave a bridge climb tour. Next, hop on the antique thrill rides at Luna Park, which is a family-friendly favorite that dates back to 1935, or saunter around Darling Harbour. Meanwhile, if you‚Äôd prefer to make a splash, dive into the waves at Bondi Beach or hang ten at nearby Manly Beach. 

Dabble in the city‚Äôs history, architecture, and beach towns, and embark on several Sydney tours during your next trip to the capital of New South Walves. To jump-start your adventure and get more tips and ideas on how to spend your Sydney sojourn, check out our travel guide video.

cS-hFKC_RKI,Tokyo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Tokyo.d179900.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Tokyo, the capital of Japan and the epitome of the word ‚Äúmegacity.‚Äù

In this vast metropolis, ancient traditions blend with futuristic buildings, and your Tokyo sightseeing will take you to representations of each. Pay your respects at temples set in forested hillsides, then flex your credit card in one of the shopping districts, before sitting down to a five-star meal‚Ä¶all in one day.

Your Tokyo tour begins with the subway and train system, which will take you all over this sprawling city. Tokyo is home to some 35 million people, many of which you‚Äôll meet as its public transit carries you throughout its many neighborhoods. Make a stop in Asakusa, a temple district nestled in leafy trees with skyscrapers towering in the background. There you‚Äôll visit Nakamisi Dori, a street loaded with food vendors and religious charms. Get to know the city a little better in the Harajuku district, home to cutting-edge fashion, a thriving, youth-centered culture, and the famous Yoyogi Park. The park stands out in stern contrast to the rest of the neighborhood; this sprawling, 134-acre green space is where locals slow down after a frenzied week of work and play.

 As night falls, make your way to Shinjuku. Many of Tokyo‚Äôs premier restaurants and pubs span Shinjuku‚Äôs streets, and you can indulge in succulent 5-star meals or sample with fast food from local vendors. Watch a movie, do some karaoke, and linger with fellow travelers and friendly locals alike.

What was your favorite part of Tokyo?

qvuv6bg9dgQ,OUR BIGGEST TRAVEL FAIL! | Day 4 | Vietnam Vlogs 2019,"When you‚Äôre young, it makes sense to go out on a limb and do something more adventurous when traveling abroad. You see the backpackers on Instagram living it up in Asia, travel bloggers living the nomad lifestyle, and it looks so fun, easy and exciting. When I imagined our trip to Ha Long I imagined all of that. 

We booked a homestay (AirBnB of Vietnam) for one night in Ha Long before our cruise in the bay the next day. I figured we had the accommodation set up. Now all we had to do was get there and start exploring. It‚Äôs 2019, this should be easy with smart phones and google maps and Grab (Uber of Vietnam). Ha. Umm. Well‚Ä¶ 

Let's just say the entire day was one big fail.

lqSoLVkYYu0,Traveling Iran by train | DW Documentary,"Iran is opening its doors to foreigners and a train ride from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea is a great way to get to know the country and its people.

The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life ‚Äì and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. 

The country‚Äôs most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.

Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.

During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.

In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin‚Äôs major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea.

A-63Yawo0zI,Learn English - Travel Vocabulary,"http://www.engvid.com/ Learn important, basic words you will need when you travel. Knowing a little English vocabulary can help a lot when you are travelling. Whever you are going in the world, you can almost always find someone who speaks some English. I'll teach you how a ""tourist attraction"" is different from a ""tourist trap"". What about ""sight seeing""? Do you know what an ""itinerary"" is? Do you have your travel documents? Get ready for your English to take flight! http://www.engvid.com/travel-vocabulary/

Hi. James, from EngVid. I was just about to plan my vacation. I'm going to take a long flight to Europe. I'm trying to remember luggage and baggage things, you know? It's kind of hard to do. But this is a lesson for you if you've been working a lot, you need some time off. Now, there's a video I would like you to go check out. That's on time off. It goes with this one. You might want to go away somewhere and not just stay home, right? So this video is for you. This is basic vocabulary on vacation. When you leave and maybe you go to an English speaking country and you want to practice your English, this stuff will be good for you to enjoy your time there, also to make it easy for you when you arrive. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Mr. E, Mr. E! It's a mystery where he is. It's no mystery. And you thought I forgot. Mr. E has been on vacation with me, and he's enjoying this particular attraction. So let's go to the board.

Now, if you're going to go on vacation, one of the first things you will have to do if you're leaving your country is you're going to need some travel documents. What are those? Documents. A ""document"" is a paper or something with information that tells you something is okay or outlines it for you. For example, your passport is a document given by the government with your picture on it that says you are a citizen of this country, and you are legal. You are a good person. Okay? Now, when you're leaving for a flight, or you want to go to another country, you're going to need travel documents first. Trust me; show up at the airport and go, ""I leave now. I go to Canada."" They will go, ""And the car is that way. Go home, crazy man. Okay?"" So we need travel documents. So what are ""travel documents""? Well, ""travel documents"" would be your passport, government identification, usually needed at most places the travel. Inside of a country, not necessary for most places. But leaving the country, you have to have it. Okay? So if you're in the European Union, no problem. If you're in Canada and the United States, you don't need one. But as soon as you leave these countries, you need a passport.

What's another thing you need? Well, you need what's called a ""boarding pass"". If you play soccer, you kick the ball; the other guy, he catches it; you ""pass"" right? The ball goes from one player to another. A ""boarding pass"" is what allows you to go from one country to another country. You show the person on the airplane this piece of paper with your passport, and they say, ""You know what? You can come on the plane and fly, like the pass."" Kick, catch, other country. Cool? All right. So these are your travel documents. You need those.

Now, I should have started with you need to make a plan because you want to go visit some place. You want to go on vacation, right? And if you want to go on vacation, well, going to have to -- I said ""vacation"". A ""vacation"" is a holiday, another word for saying ""time off from work"". All right? So you want to go on vacation. Sometimes, we say, ""We're going to vacation in Italy."" Or ""on my vacation, I want to visit Italy."" Or ""I'm taking a holiday in Italy."" Okay? So all these words, when people say, ""Well, what are you doing on your time off?"" You might go, ""I'm going on vacation."" Then they know you're leaving. If you just say, ""I'm taking time off from work"", you could be home cleaning. But no. You're saying, ""I'm going on vacation."" They're going to go, ""Where are you going to visit? Italy, perhaps? Sicily? Is it going to be a good holiday?"" And you go, ""Yes. I earned my time."" ""Earned"" means to work for something. ""I earned my time off. I'm going on vacation.""",travel

The Panama Canal is a 77.1-kilometre (48 mi) ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean (via the Caribbean Sea) to the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 metres (85 ft) above sea level. The current locks are 33.5 metres (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks is currently under construction and is due to open in 2016.

France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States took over the project in 1904, and took a decade to complete the canal, which was officially opened on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. The shorter, faster, and safer route to the U.S. West Coast and to nations in and around the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy. It takes between 20 and 30 hours to traverse the canal.

During construction, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American‚ÄìPanamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999, and is now managed and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a Panamanian government agency.

Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax. The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.",travel

Amsterdam is the largest city in The Netherlands, also known as Holland. The fun-loving Dutch welcome 3.5 million tourists a year, making Amsterdam one of the top destinations in Europe.

No Amsterdam tour is complete without exploring some of its 165 canals and 1,000 bridges ‚Äì hopefully you like water. Don‚Äôt worry; you don‚Äôt need a boat or even a motor vehicle to get around. The heart of this ancient city is best seen on foot or from the seat of a bicycle. This city is rich in history; when you set out to explore ‚ÄúThe Venice of the North,‚Äù you‚Äôll find buildings dating back to the 13th century, as well as Dam Square and its royal palace. 

If you‚Äôve got an appreciation for fine art, your Amsterdam sightseeing should pause at the Rijksmuseum, where you can find the works of Rembrandt and other Dutch masters. Up for a pint? Stop by the old Heineken Brewery and learn about the lager brewing process. If you‚Äôre really feeling daring, grab a coffee in De Wallen, better known as one of the world‚Äôs oldest red light districts. You won‚Äôt get into trouble with your partner if you head there these days; it‚Äôs now home to cafes and adult stores.

Deloreons, blue boxes, hot tubs, we are obsessed with time travel. While mainstream science wants us to believe that time is linear, some are saying that‚Äôs not quite it. Perhaps it is because we are so desperate to want to go back into the past and change our mistakes, or even try to change history itself! Time travel has been, and will always be, a major plot device for fiction. Books and movies will always come up with a new way for their characters to travel through time. But is it possible that time travel could actually exist? According to physicists, time travel does indeed exist and it‚Äôs already happened...several times! Why hasn‚Äôt this made the news? Well, think about it; if there‚Äôs word that time travel is possible, could you imagine the public outcry that would happen? People would say that the past happened for a reason that wasn‚Äôt natural and demand that we go back in time. What if a rip happened in the space-time continuum? There‚Äôs theories that Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves are time travelers too!

In this video, we‚Äôre going to tell you about ten theories that prove time travel actually exists. From disappearing aircraft carriers to modern technology popping up in ancient Greece and Egypt, these stories present a pretty compelling argument that we have the capability to hop around all over the timeline. There are video clips dating back to the early 1900‚Äôs of people walking around and talking on cell phones! Where did they even get their reception? Take a peek at this video and see what we‚Äôre talking about.

Fabulously wealthy and gilded by history, the Principality of Monaco lies on the French Riviera in Western Europe. Smaller than New York‚Äôs Central Park, this graceful destination is bordered by France and the sparkling Mediterranean sea.

With ancient streets full of exotic cars, a natural harbour filled with super yachts and a glittering royal legacy, Monaco is a tiny relic of medieval Europe that has made itself at home in the 21st century.

There is a lot of conflicting information out there on the different websites for the dimensions of the suitcases. We wanted swivel wheels as well as the biggest carry-on that the airlines would allow. For each of the carryon suite cases, we examine the size, pockets, webbing, and handle.

Almost all airlines in 2018 state that the maximum carry-on suitcase dimensions are 9"" x 14"" x 22"". Two of these options actually measure larger, but we took them to the airport and tried them in the American Airlines, Allegiant Air, and United Airlines sizer bins to test them out.

mPs_lCNRNDU,Helsinki Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Helsinki.d178261.Destination-Travel-Guides

Finland‚Äôs thriving waterfront capital, Helsinki, is situated at the northeastern edge of the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Russia.

Start voyaging through Helsinki‚Äôs history by taking the ferry from Market Square to Suomenlinna Fortress, the battlements of which have protected the Gulf of Finland for almost 300 years. 

Helsinki has an abundance of museums and galleries across the city, including the Helsinki Design Museum, which features a permanent exhibition devoted to the great moments of Finnish design.

Continue your design journey at Temppeliaukio Church, a favorite with touring musicians. Helsinki is home to many structures dedicated to theatrical and musical productions. Two of the most iconic are Finlandia Hall and the Helsinki Music Centre. 

Wander through Esplanadi, often referred to as the living room of the city. From here, walk north to Senate Square, which fans out from the fatherly gaze of Emperor Alexander II. 

Climb the stairs to the foot of Helsinki Cathedral, a breathtaking whitewashed structure that towers above the rest of the city. Stare up at the twelve apostles, ten-foot-tall zinc statues which stand like wise custodians. 

In stark contrast to Helsinki Cathedral is its brooding younger brother, Uspenski Cathedral. Built with dark bricks, the cathedral is powerfully conspicuous as it rises from the surrounding white granite of the Katajanokka district. 

Celebrations of education and creativity mean Helsinki is a city designed for life. Its long-held reputation as one of the world‚Äôs happiest places lures people from all over the world. And now, it is calling to you.",travel
9J4a37-h9Y8,Long Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/Long-Island.d602887.Destination-Travel-Guides

Long Island stretches eastward for 115 miles, from the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to the bluffs of Montauk Point.
¬†
Take the short train ride from Manhattan to the sands of Long Beach, which for many is where¬†Long Island¬†begins. From here, Long Island‚Äôs protective barrier islands continue all the way to Westhampton Island. Halfway along the chain, visit Fire Island Lighthouse, which for generations of immigrants was their first glimpse of America.
¬†
Many of those immigrants went on to create vast financial empires, and it was on Long Island‚Äôs¬†northern shores¬†where they built the mansions that would inspire F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs classic,¬†The Great Gatsby.
¬†
At the Cradle of Aviation Museum in nearby Hempstead, discover how Long Island launched generations of aviators into the wild blue yonder. Nearby, continue your flight into the past at the American Airpower Museum.
¬†
In the mid 1800s, well-to-do New Yorkers were drawn to the unspoiled beaches of Long Island‚Äôs East End. Today, the pioneer settlement of Southampton Village is a place where history and style have blended as smoothly as the spirits in a Long Island Iced Tea. The past been also been beautifully preserved in nearby Sag Harbor, a historic whaling port immortalized in Moby Dick.
¬†
Just a 30-minute drive east from Sag Harbor is Montauk, a place locals refer to as ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù. America‚Äôs first president, George Washington, commissioned Montauk Lighthouse on Long Island‚Äôs easternmost point. Climb to the top to take in the sweeping views of this place that has played center stage in some of America‚Äôs greatest stories.",travel

Transcript:

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it‚Äôs one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver‚Äôs clean air is thanks to it‚Äôs really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn‚Äôt just a place, it‚Äôs a way of life. But it‚Äôs a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we‚Äôre going to help you make the most of it! We‚Äôre going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let‚Äôs get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward ‚Äì a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain ‚Äì it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

Now it‚Äôs not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There‚Äôs ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn‚Äôt too bad in our experience.",travel

N8bHCHl8X_0,Lisbon Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Lisbon-District.d178278.Destination-Travel-Guides

From its days as a Phoenician outpost to its expansion into a 16th¬†century trading giant, from the Great Earthquake of 1755 to its glorious reconstruction, Lisbon has long been a city of shifting fortunes.
¬†
Lisbon has forever been linked to the sea and it‚Äôs on the waterfront where you‚Äôll find the city‚Äôs grand gateway, Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio. Pass beneath the triumphal arch, a tribute to the city‚Äôs reconstruction, and drift down Rua Augusta to another of Lisbon‚Äôs great squares, the Rossio.
¬†
Climb aboard Tram 28, which passes some of the city‚Äôs most iconic sights, then climb the battlements of Castelo de S√£o Jorge to see the red tiled roofs of Lisbon spread out before you.
¬†
Although the Great Earthquake reduced much of Lisbon to rubble, the ancient suburb of Alfama was spared. Lose yourself amid the cobblestones, where cafes, bars and artisan shops have taken residence in the dockworkers homes of old. As the sun gets low, join locals in a fado bar to hear heartrending songs of the working class.
¬†
20 miles west of the city is Cascais, a sleepy fishing village until Lisbon‚Äôs nobility discovered its golden bays in the late 1800s.¬†¬†Another playground for Portugal‚Äôs Monarchs was Sintra, which¬†Hans Christian Andersen¬†called the most beautiful place in Portugal.
¬†

After Sintra,¬†spend a few days exploring some of Europe‚Äôs most beautiful beaches, such as Praia das Ma√ß√£s, Adraga and Ursa.¬†At Cape Roca, stand upon the clifftop, which until the 14th¬†century was considered¬†the end of the world.",travel

hbCAh6vGgJ0,A Travel Photographer&#39;s Diary - Otherworldly landscapes &amp; Carnival,"This travel photographer's diary is the continuation of my journey around North Chile. When the roads opened up, I drove to San Pedro De Atacama. It‚Äôs one of Chile‚Äôs main attractions and one of the most special and visually stunning areas I‚Äôve been to. 

üì∏ The Blueprint To Award-Worthy Photos (My course) - https://goo.gl/2obNBB
üì∑ MY FREE educational website ‚Äì The Photographic Process - https://goo.gl/mDHe1w

San Pedro De Atacama is known for the Moon Valley (Valle de la luna) Death Valley (Valle de Marte) and otherworldly landscapes almost everywhere you look. 

I touch on some unexpected developments in this video too. The carnival celebrations were something I came upon purely by chance. Also, I thought I‚Äôd share a short story about an awkward, but memorable encounter at the celebrations. 

Will there be a 3rd video? I did put together a very rough edit, it‚Äôs about a part in the high mountains and my way back to Peru. But, many things came up and I wasn‚Äôt able to finish it. I already had other stuff in the pipeline and I had to prioritise that. What do you folks think? Want to see a 3rd part? Tell me in the comments. 

As always, ask me anything video-related and‚Ä¶ tell me what you think.

IguTMV4LfK4,Canada From Coast To Coast Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Traveling with the train through entire Canada.
Halifax is the capital of the province of Nova Scotia and the oldest British settlement in Canada.  One of the most impressive ways to explore Canada is to travel by train.   The journey across the second largest country in the world begins at the train station close to Halifax Harbour and travels from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast covering thousands of miles.  The trains of today‚Äôs Via Rail are both comfortable and nostalgic and their elevated panoramic windows provide an excellent view of Canada‚Äôs remarkable scenery. Quebec was founded in 1608 by famous explorer Samuel De Champlain but  the city‚Äôs most well known and prominent landmark is the 19th century Chateau Frontenac Hotel, the traditional stopover hotel of the Canadian Pacific Railway that offers first class service plus a lavish and historical ambience. Qu√©bec‚Äôs historic buildings, various gates, city walls and old houses that date back to the18th and 19th centuries are still in remarkably good condition.  Up until the late 18th century the city was a French possession but following several decades of hostilities the British finally conquered the city. In Montr√©al the architecture of bygone times blends in with the modern skyscrapers of today. Around three million people live in Canada‚Äôs second largest city, the biggest French-speaking metropolis outside France.  The Ville Souterraine, Underground City is an amazing world of shops and extends for almost thirty kilometres with a large network of tunnels, magnificent shopping arcades, hotel and cinema complexes and two thousand retail stores. The next stop on this journey across Canada is Toronto, one of the fastest growing cities in North America.   A prominent landmark is the fabulous CN Tower, the highest freestanding tower in the world.  Nearby is another spectacular building, the Skydome, a huge multi-purpose arena that can seat seventy thousand spectators and is home to the city‚Äôs baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays. Niagara Falls, The Rocky Mountains and the last stop on the journey, Vancouver ‚Äì one of the most beautiful cities in the world ‚Äì Canada is a truly vast paradise in a fast-changing world!

TRANSCRIPT

Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's video I'm going to talk about something I love, and that is travel. So, if you like travelling too, if you're planning on going on a vacation, or if you know somebody who's travelling, this video will be very, very helpful to you. In this video I'm going to teach you some very important verbs. They're all phrasal verbs, and I'll explain what a phrasal verb is in a moment. So, these are all verbs that we use when we're talking about travel. Okay.

So, to get started, I wanted to tell you a little bit about phrasal verbs. What is a phrasal verb? One of the difficulties students have with English are verbs where you have a verb and a preposition. So, when you see a verb and a preposition together, that's a phrasal verb. Now, you might be thinking: ""What's a preposition?"" Good question. I'm going to give you an example. We have here four words, each of these is a phrasal verb. They all have the verb ""get"": ""get in"", ""get up"", ""get on"", ""get over"", and there's many more, ""get away"". There's tons of them. Each of these actually can have multiple meanings, too. So, one of the most difficult parts about English is learning phrasal verbs, because this, the blue part is the preposition, it can change the meaning of the verb. Okay? So, prepositions are words like: ""on"", ""off"", ""up"", ""down"", ""toward"", ""over"", ""away"", these types of words are prepositions. So, you'll notice with phrasal verbs, they're very, very common in conversation. They're... You can write them down, too, but in general, when people talk they often use phrasal verbs. Okay? So, they're very, very important, especially when you're talking about going on a trip with your friends or family.

So let's look at some of the common phrasal verbs we use when we're talking about trips. The first verb I want to teach you: ""Drop off"". Okay? So: ""drop"" is the verb, ""off"" is the preposition, together: ""drop off"" is a phrasal verb. What does this mean: ""drop off""? When you ""drop someone off"" it means you're taking them to a place and then you leave them there. So, for example, maybe your friend needs to go to the airport, so you drive them to the airport and you drop them off at the airport. This means you take them there and you leave them in that place. Okay? So they don't come home with you; they stay there. So, for example, I have a friend named Frank, and when Frank goes travelling: ""We drop Frank off at the airport."" So, we drive Frank to the airport, he has all his luggage, his suitcases, and then we say to Frank: ""Goodbye, Frank, you know, have a nice trip."" We drop Frank off at the airport. You can also use ""drop off"" in a lot of other situations. For example, when you were a child maybe your parents, your mom or your dad, or maybe your grandparents dropped you off at school. This means that they took you to school, and then once you got to school, they would say goodbye to you and they would leave. So: ""drop off"" means you take someone to a place, and then you leave them there. You'll also notice... So, I have here the verb and the preposition. ""Frank"" is a name of a person and it's in the middle of ""drop"" and ""off"". Okay? So, these two are not together. We drop somebody off at the airport. Okay? So, sometimes with phrasal verbs... For some phrasal verbs you actually separate them, and you can put the names of somebody between them; for other ones you can't do that. For this one: ""drop off"", you put the name between the two... Between the verb and the preposition.

So, now let's look at another example of a common phrasal verb. ""See off"". Okay? So, again, we have ""off"" in both of these. ""See off"" is when... It's similar to ""drop off"", but it's a little bit different. Sometimes your family or your friends are going away for a long time, maybe they're going on a vacation or a trip, so you want to ""see them off"". It means you want to say goodbye to them at the airport, at the train station, maybe at their house. So, it's that goodbye you say before somebody goes off on a vacation. Okay? So, for example: ""We see Frank off."" Frank is going to Australia, so we go to the airport because we want to say goodbye to Frank, so: ""We see Frank off"" is another way to say: ""We say goodbye to Frank when he goes on his trip.""",travel

GHDtG4_Eq_c,Philadelphia Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Philadelphia.d178297.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Philadelphia, considered the birthplace of the United States.

The Declaration of Independence was written and read publicly here in 1776. When you tour Philadelphia, you‚Äôll get a sense of the history that permeates the city through its numerous monuments, symbols, and other landmarks, such as the First Bank of the United States and the warship USS Olympia. Don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Liberty Bell and the remains of the Eastern State Penitentiary, which housed notorious criminals like Al Capone. 

You don‚Äôt need a car to enjoy your Philadelphia sightseeing; take public transportation or rent a bike to explore the city streets at your leisure. Fairmount Park is the perfect place for a stroll, and if you‚Äôve got kids, bring them to the Please Touch Museum, where they can enjoy interactive exhibits and displays that will educate and entertain. If you‚Äôve still got some energy after that, visit the Philadelphia Zoo and make friends with some of the animals. Don‚Äôt forget to sample some of the delicious food available in Philadelphia, particularly the fresh goods and cooked meals at the Italian Market. 

From culinary delicacies to historical importance, Philadelphia truly has it all.

St. Petersburg 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ISUUO0CSo

Kyoto:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The island of Santorini has a pretty explosive past. It‚Äôs perched over the remains of a much larger land mass that sank almost 4,000 years ago when a volcano blew its top, leaving the blue caldera and steep cliffs behind. 

It is these cliffs and the flooded caldera that have become Santorini‚Äôs iconic calling card, and the first stop on your Santorini tour. Here‚Äôs your first bit of trivia: The whitewashed homes that appear on so many postcards and photographs are larger than they appear on the outside. They‚Äôre partially built into existing cliffside caves, and feature some of the most distinctive Mediterranean architecture you‚Äôll ever see. 

Santorini sightseeing will no doubt bring you up the stairs and pathways to the blue-domed churches that stand guard over the island. From there, you can take in the exquisite view of the caldera and harbor below. If you get a little weary of the spectacular sights, don‚Äôt worry; there‚Äôs plenty of things to do besides wander the various clifftop towns. If you head down to water level, you can soak in the warm surf, explore Santorini‚Äôs many beaches, go for a drive along winding roads, or go on a fishing expedition from one of the harbors. 

At the end of the day, gather with the residents and visitors atop the cliff towns and watch the sun drop into the ocean. You‚Äôll never see a view quite like it.

What part of Santorini do you want to see?

N3ISUUO0CSo,St. Petersburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Four hundred miles west of Moscow is St. Petersburg, Russia. A striking city resting on the banks of the Neva River, St. Petersburg has long been a draw for lovers of architecture, as St. Petersburg tours often begin with the city's legendary structures.

Enter a world of towering cathedrals, palaces, and gardens, many of them set down by the order of Peter the Great in the 18th century. As the decades passed, later members of Russian royalty added to the city's opulence by constructing additional marvels. Walk through the Palace Square, located in the heart of St. Petersburg and home of the Winter Palace, the sprawling home of Catherine the Great. Next, pay a visit to St. Isaac's Cathedral and its gold-plated dome, which glitters in the sunshine. If you walk to the top of its dome, you will be rewarded with astonishing views of the city.

Continue your St. Petersburg sightseeing by taking a boat ride down the river to Peterhof Gardens & Palace. This gilded structure and its lush array of plant life was constructed to rival France's Palace of Versailles, and is a popular place for a quiet walk in nature or to reflect upon the engineering marvel of its 60 fountains, all of which flow continuously without the use of pumps. 

Spend your evening walking along Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's main thoroughfare. Besides offering even more beautiful architecture to gaze upon, Nevsky Prospect is loaded with restaurants and boutiques. Enjoy a delicious meal, shop around for the perfect Russian souvenir, and plan the itinerary for your next day in this magnificent city.

What was your favorite part of St. Petersburg?

Time Travel Explained | Did Gautama Buddha Time Travel ? | Sadhguru | Adiyogi

Sadhguru relates time travel to instances of people who don't have control over their imaginations. Instead, he discusses the concept of creation of bodies periodically through time. The experience of time and how life experiences time is very different. There are multiple perspectives of time that one must consider when questioning time travel.

Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/adiyogi1008 
Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/adiyogi1008/ 
Twitter - https://twitter.com/adiyogi1008 

Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. An arresting blend of profundity and pragmatism, his life and work serves as a reminder that yoga is a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.

LcKnx7I97yk,Dublin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Despite a long and sometimes tragic history of invasion and resistance, this thriving business capital has poetry, music and literature percolating through its cobblestones.

Dubliner, Oscar Wilde once said ‚Äúlife is too important to be taken seriously.‚Äù While Dublin proudly honours its past, it is equally passionate about enjoying each and every new day. Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city‚Äôs nearly 700 pubs. Nothing matters more to Dubliners than having a good time or, as locals call it, the craic.

Of all the gifts, Dublin has given to the world, perhaps the most intoxicating are its stories. Originally built for the sons of the Irish gentry, the ivy-covered stone buildings of Trinity College are home to some of the oldest remaining manuscripts in the world, including the 1000-year-old Book of Kells.

Dubliner Jonathan Swift, once said, ‚ÄúMay you live all the days of your life.‚Äù There is no better way to define Dublin. Its passion for life is contagious, captivating and sure to stay with you for the rest of your days.

kYXiegTXsEs,The value of travel | Rick Steves | TEDxRainier,"After spending 4 months a year for the last 30 years living out of a suitcase, Rick Steves reflects on the value of thoughtful travel. Sharing lessons learned from Iran to El Salvador and from India to Denmark, Steves tells why spending all that time and money away from home has broadened his perspective, enriched his life, and made it clear to him, as he says in his talk, ""Fear is for people who don't get out very much."" 

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",travel

9fJEFi3ccwI,Yosemite National Park Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Yosemite-National-Park.d180672.Destination-Travel-Guides

Yosemite National Park sits on the western slopes of California‚Äôs Sierra Nevada Mountains. Most visitors spend their time in Yosemite Valley, which despite being only 7 miles long and 1 mile wide, packs in more jaw-dropping scenery than just about any other place on Earth. 
 
Near the valley entrance stop at Tunnel View, and stand before a panorama that‚Äôs reduced generations of visitors to silence. From Tunnel View it‚Äôs just a short drive to Bridalveil Fall. Fed by snowmelt, the fall reaches its thundering peak in May. 
 
The Yosemite Valley ring road follows the banks of the Merced River, which shifts in character as it thunders from the valley walls, before gently winding across the valley floor. The ring road is dotted with trailheads that lead to 800 miles of hiking trails. The Four Mile Trail climbs the valley‚Äôs southern wall to two of Yosemite‚Äôs great outlooks, Glacier Point and Washburn Point. Further along the ring road is the trailhead for The Mist Trail, which offers stunning views of Vernal and Nevada Falls. 
 
For thousands of years, the Ahwaneechee had villages throughout this valley, but it was at the base of Yosemite Falls where their great chief resided. Take the one-hour hike to the lower falls, or spend the day climbing all the way to the upper falls.
 
To the north of Yosemite Valley, is Tioga Road, one of the USA‚Äôs most scenic highways. Fill your lungs with alpine air at Olmsted Point, refresh yourself by the waters of Tenaya Lake, then spend the day at Tuolumne Meadow, the traditional summer hunting grounds of the Ahwaneechee. 
 
From its high country to its waterfalls, its towering sequoia groves to its valley meadows, Yosemite is an American story unlike any other.",travel

-----------------------------------------------
Japan remains one of the most intensely fascinating places in the world, effortlessly intertwining modernity and tradition. Seek serenity in Kyoto by visiting one of thousands of temples spread throughout this former capital, or go skiing in Niseko or summit Mt. Fuji. Of course you can also kick back in one of the country‚Äôs many hot springs, where the rich mountain minerals will leave your skin feeling brand new. Once you‚Äôve achieved maximum relaxation, hit up Tokyo‚Äôs bustling night life or go hiking in Kamakura. 

What Japan lacks in square footage it makes up for in endless options for your itinerary. In this case, size definitely doesn‚Äôt matter! Consider booking a tour that allows you to see all of the country‚Äôs unique highlights, without missing the subtleties you can enjoy as a backpacker: http://www.tourradar.com/d/japan

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the region you‚Äôre visiting, and if you‚Äôre planning on travelling from the North to the South outside of summer months, make sure you bring everything from flip-flops to snow boots. 

Japan‚Äôs currency is the Japanese Yen. Credit card and debit transactions aren‚Äôt common, so be sure to bring plenty of cash with you no matter where you travel within the country. Dining out doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you can often enjoy a pre-fix menu for lunch for a very reasonable cost. Be sure to sample the Japanese whiskeys, as Japan is an expert whiskey distiller! 

‚Äî About Japan ‚Äî

With a population of nearly 130 million, this island nation is resides in the Pacific Ocean and has everything from dense cities to mountainous national parks. You‚Äôll discover that there‚Äôs countless reasons to move Japan up to the #1 spot on your bucket list. Sixty-six percent of the country is covered by trees and the Japanese enjoy the highest life expectancy in the world at 83.7 years.

Jd1wzlwtKJ0,Kyoto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Kyoto, Japan, has long been considered one of the country‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Once the capital of the nation, Kyoto is now an ultra-modern haven that retains a great deal of its ancient charm.

To see some of this long-established glamour, make your way to Kyoto Tower. Just two miles east of the tower is Gion, an entertainment quarter and home to many of Kyoto‚Äôs famous geishas. As you walk east through Gion, you‚Äôll find even more old architecture, including several Ryokan, or traditional Japanese inns. Many date back to the Edo period, which ranged from 1603 to 1868. 

During your Kyoto tour, take a rickshaw ride to the Sannen-zaka and Ninen-zaka districts, where cars are prohibited and traditional teahouses and temples adorn the nearby landscape. Kyoto is known as ‚ÄúThe City of Ten Thousand Shrines‚Äù for good reason. Walk through the great open plazas of the Haian Shrine, or spend a quiet moment in the intimate confines of the Shorenin Temple and its beautiful gardens.  

The most famous of Kyoto‚Äôs temples is Fushimi Inari-taisha, a stunning red complex that sprawls over Mount Inari, which is named after and dedicated to Inari, the fox spirit. A hike to the summit takes about two hours, and will lead you through thousands of colorful sub-shrines and thick, ancient forest. Once you‚Äôre at the top, you‚Äôll have a stunning view of Kyoto. 

What is your favorite part of Kyoto?

c4z6RZXv5p8,Interstellar Travel: Approaching Light Speed,"Is interstellar travel doomed to remain in the realm of science fiction? Sticking to near future space propulsion only, how close can we get to the speed of light?

This video looks at the current spacecraft speed records with Apollo 10 holding the record for the fastest manned spacecraft, New Horizons probe for the fastest Earth escape velocity and the Helios probes for the fastest heliocentric velocity. But Solar Probe Plus will beat that when it launches in 2018. While Voyager 1 doesn't set any speed records, it was the first spacecraft to leave the solar system, so therefore the fastest solar system escape velocity by default.

For beating these speeds, this video explores what is possible in the near future only, so no antimatter, Alcubierre drives (warp), ramjets, etc... The EM drive is left out until it's proven with actual reproducible results in space.

Project Daedalus and the updated Project Icarus represent sound concepts for fusion spacecraft. IKAROS was the first successful demonstration of solar sail technology but hopefully the planetary society is not far behind with their LightSail cubsat (not covered in this video).

But what appears to have the most potential to reach the nearest star to our own, Proxima Centauri and it's newly discovered planet Proxima b is Breakthrough Starshot. Thousands of super lightweight laser sail nanocraft will be launched into space then the light beamer, a ground based laser array will propel these spacecraft to 20% light speed within minutes.

RImMePAPhkg,Sicily Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Sicily in Italy.
Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean and is the most diverse region in Italy,a land of gods and natural forces and a place of ancient cultures. Throughout the history of Sicily there have been many battles, rulers, cultures and religions. Prior to Roman rule both the Greeks and the Carthagians fought against each other. Later came the Arabs and the Normans. Catania is Sicily‚Äôs second largest city and has been strongly influenced by earthquakes and also the volcanic activity of Mount Etna. Therefore only a few historical remnants have survived. However, after each disaster the city was rebuilt and the result is a Baroque city dominated by fascinating sights full of character and charm. A devastating earthquake in 1693 destroyed the original town of Noto and left it in ruins. Construction of the new town took almost a hundred years until at end of the eighteenth century most of its buildings had been rebuilt. In addition to the geometrical design of its streets the remarkable architectural harmony of the town has been created by much use of ochre-coloured sandstone. The privately-owned train, the Ferrovia Circumetnea, travels around Mount Etna from Catania to Riposto. A couple of kilometres outside Catania there are vast fertile fields. In the background is the mighty and over three thousand metre high Mount Etna, one of the most active and famous volcanoes in the world. Taormina is situated on a rock high above the Ionic Sea. The Teatro Greco was built out of the stone of Monte Tauro in the third century A.D. and five hundred years later it was enlarged by the Romans for gladiatorial battle. The old town ended at Porta Messina whose medieval palaces and villas have been preserved right up until the present day. A few kilometres from Palermo and set within a beautiful bay is Mondello sheltered by the slopes of Monte Pellegrino that contains a grotto, an altar and a pilgrims church, the Santuario Di Santa Rosalia. Here this fascinating journey comes to an end. Sicily is exquisite, an ancient island of both discovery and pleasure.

iB4XbL_PmzQ,Atlanta Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Atlanta.d178232.Destination-Travel-Guides

Atlanta, Georgia, is home to 5.5 million people. When you venture into the lush foliage that engulfs much of Atlanta and frames its many skyscrapers, you‚Äôll immediately understand why it‚Äôs referred to as ‚ÄúThe City in a Forest.‚Äù 

An Atlanta tour must include the Atlanta History Center. Learn about the city‚Äôs roots as a railways terminal, as well as its role in the Civil War, when it was nearly burned to the ground. Fact became fiction when Margaret Mitchell featured Atlanta as a major setting in her novel, ‚ÄúGone With the Wind,‚Äù and you can learn about the author and the book at the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum.

Stop by the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site to learn about the Civil Rights leader, and pay your respects at his final resting place. From there, your Atlanta sightseeing should continue at the Georgia Aquarium, where you can meet some beluga whales, swim with whale-sharks, and get up close and personal with sealife in the touch tanks. 

Cap off a beautiful day with a trip to Stone Mountain Park. If you take the Summit Skyride, you‚Äôll get an outstanding view of the city.

wn89rYh09MM,Nice Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"When you plan a trip to Nice, France, you‚Äôre in good company: This city has been a tourist destination since at least the 18th century. The European aristocracy often spent their winters in the pleasant climate, with a sunset walk on the shoreline being the highlight of each day.

You can walk in their footsteps‚Äîliterally‚Äîwith a stroll down the Promenade des Anglais, which roughly translates to Walkway of the English. On a tour of Nice, you‚Äôll enjoy the mixture of French and Italian culture that permeates the city‚Äôs architecture, public art, and yes, the food. Bon appetit!

The residents of Nice love the outdoors, and you will, too, as you explore the Place Massena‚Äîthe city‚Äôs main square, where you can enjoy a snack at a caf√© or do some shopping in its many boutiques. Any Nice sightseeing requires exploration of one of the many open-air markets, where you can pick up fresh produce, local artwork, and French pastries that will leave you wondering why you waited so long to visit. 

Cap a perfect day in Nice with a dip in the ocean and a walk along the seashore, watching the sun disappear into the sea.

What are you going to eat while in Nice?

SIM CARD
Another options is to get a SIM card for your unlocked mobile device.  You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options, but I‚Äôll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.  

(1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.  

(2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.  It doesn‚Äôt have a daily transfer limit which I personally prefer.  And if I use up all the data in only a few days, you can just buy a new card.

AQ6GmpMu5L8,Paris Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Paris.d179898.Destination-Travel-Guides

Paris, the capital of France, attracts 42 million visitors a year. 

You can start your Paris tour on the metro, on foot, or with a taxi or bicycle; the city is easily navigable on all fronts. Visit the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the city and marvel at its graceful lines and commanding presence. Built between 1806 and 1836, the Arc is one of a number of historical arches and landmarks peppering Paris.

If your Paris sightseeing includes purchasing souvenirs, head to the Champs-√âlys√©es, home of boutique shopping, numerous restaurants, and many bars, along with a theatre and other entertaining venues. Learn about culture and creativity at the Louvre, a 14th-century palace turned art museum, and check in on the Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile. Notre Dame Cathedral cannot be missed, as this imposing Gothic structure has stood since 1345.

Speaking of imposing, the Eiffel Tower is most frequently used to represent Paris. Stroll beneath it to get a good idea of its height, or travel to the top for a stunning view of the City of Light.

Vm-MMki4sY4,Uzbekistan (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan is a country with thousands of years of history and contains all the magic of the Silk Road, as well as numerous oriental fairy tales, along with traditional culture, Islamic history and fascinating desert landscapes. Tashkent is the city of Amir Timur, the riding general who established a dynasty.  It is a city on the ancient Silk Road, famous in both orient and occident, and having inspired both scholars and poets, plus craftsmen and artists.  Modern Tashkent contains wide boulevards and plenty of lush greenery.  White storks that symbolize fertility crown the large entrance arcades to the Place Of Independence. Samarqand was the centre of one of the oldest forms of state in Middle Asia, and was located on the Silk Road.  Newly introduced Timurid style further enriched the architecture.  Coloured mosaics of astounding luminosity compete with glazed relief ceramics whose ornamentation is composed of arabesques, font characters and geometrical shapes.  Samarqand Bazaar now has a new, modern appearance and the variety of goods on offer has never been better with fresh fruit, vegetables, honey and cheese. The ‚ÄòWild West‚Äô of Uzbekistan is a wonderful region of deserts with just a few yurt camps for overnight accommodation.  Qirk Qiz Qala emerges from the middle of the flat, featureless desert.  Almost mystically, the final sharp fragments of the castle‚Äôs former defensive towers emerge from the ground which consist mainly of gravel and are covered with low saxaul bushes that defy the desert‚Äôs strong winds with their deep-reaching roots. The oasis city of Khiva is one of the greatest centres of ancient Korezm, ‚ÄòLand of the sun‚Äô, and was where mathematician Mohammed, who discovered algebra, once lived.  Almost fifteen hundred years of oriental culture are hidden within the intriguing winding streets of this fine oasis city. Uzbekistan has always been at the intersection of major trade and cultural routes and a border between Asia and Europe, between nomads and the Western world.  Exoticism mixed with all the magic of the One Thousand And One Nights!

The largest town in southern Netherlands (and the fifth largest in the country), Eindhoven is well worth exploring. Known by locals as ""Lichtstad"" - the City of Light - due to its connections with electronics giant Philips (a monument near the station is dedicated to the company founder's son), this modern town is one of the country's industrial powerhouses. Located on the River Dommel, its rapid growth began soon after the establishment of the Philips works in 1891 and was cemented with the founding of the car and truck manufacturer, DAF. A busy university town, the city is home to a diverse collection of tourist attractions, from art museums to historic churches and lovely parks. It's also notable for its connection to Vincent Van Gogh who lived and painted in the nearby village of Neunen.

KtRsk4Bjs9s,Perth Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Perth.d180013.Destination-Travel-Guides

A modern city, Perth is the gem of Australia‚Äôs west coast and the capital of Western Australia. This friendly metropolis boasts pristine beaches, clear water, and plenty of coastline ‚Äì not to mention an abundance of nature and mineral resources.

Start your day of Perth sightseeing with a walk through Kings Park, which is larger than New York‚Äôs Central Park and home to the Western Australia Botanic Garden. More than 3,000 species of Western Australia‚Äôs plant life, including vibrant flowers, are on display here. Most of the park consists of bushland, which means lots of wildlife and quite a few walking trails.

After a morning of reflection in the park, head over to the Swan Bell Tower to enjoy a spectacular view of the city. Don‚Äôt forget your camera! You will notice the diverse nature of Perth‚Äôs architecture from this vantage point, including the modern glass structures and London-inspired Tudor buildings. 

Perth tours are never complete without a ferry ride to Rottnest Island, affectionately called ‚ÄúRotto‚Äù by the locals. This getaway is rife with opportunities to snorkel in the Indian Ocean, see wildlife such as seals and birds, and travel across more than 31 miles of cycle ways on a rented bicycle.

Once your feet are back on mainland Western Australia, visit one of the jewels, and ultimately what draws much of the Perth tourism: Swan Valley. This region has a landscape peppered with vineyards, no surprise given that growing grapes has been a long-standing tradition in Swan Valley. Following a short (or leisurely paced) day trip to Swan Valley, return to Perth and head to Hillarys Boat Harbour for a sunset dinner. 

What will you do in Perth?

IyBq4AdBKJI,Niagara Falls Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Niagara-Falls.d6023515.Destination-Travel-Guides

Niagara Falls has long been a symbol of natural power and beauty. Visit this hallmark of Canadian and American tourism and see its majesty from a helicopter, boat, or walkway.

Your Niagara Falls tour begins with a little bit of information: more than six million cubic feet of water spill over the sides per minute. You can explore three waterfalls, the most famous being the Canadian Horseshoe Falls, which are the widest and most powerful. Take a half-hour boat cruise and bask in the falls‚Äô mist, or enter a special set of walkways behind the falls and see the strength and might of the rushing water right in front of you.

No Niagara Falls sightseeing trip is complete without exploring the Botanical Gardens or Niagara on the Lake. The latter attraction offers boutiques, eateries, and picturesque views of the water you won‚Äôt soon forget.

8P-iPXsylrk,Traveling Ecuador by train | DW Travel Documentary,"The train line through Ecuador is considered one of the most spectacular train lines in South America. A train journey of discovery.

The Trans-Andean railroad takes in the infamous Nariz del Diablo, or Devil‚Äôs Nose, a mountain with almost perpendicular walls. To overcome this obstacle, the train zigzags to ascend 500 meters in less than 12 kilometers. With steep ascents and descents, it‚Äôs no ride for the faint-hearted! The main line along the country‚Äôs Andean spine links the coastal city of Guayaquil with the capital Quito. It was finished in 1908, but was mostly shut down after a series of weather-related disasters destroyed much of the Ecuadorian rail network in the 1990s. After extensive restoration, a new cross-Andean service was opened in 2013, following the original narrow-gauge line. It‚Äôs 450 kilometers long and runs from the Pacific coast up to the Andean highlands. On its cross-country journey, the train is accompanied by guards on motorcycles who, in the absence of railway gates, stop traffic at every level crossing along the way to let the train pass. The Tren Crucero, - or ""cruise train""- is the centerpiece of Ecuador‚Äôs rejuvenated railway. A revamped luxury steam train, it runs once a fortnight and has room for 54 passengers. The most exhilarating stretch of the ride begins deep down in the gorge of the River Chanch√°n. The train zigzags up the Nariz del Diablo - the ""Devil's Nose"" - in a series of dizzying switchbacks in which the tracks almost seem to lie on top of each other. Join the reporters for the ride of a lifetime, as the train journeys on to Urbina, the highest station at 3,609 meters above sea level, and along the so-called Avenue of Volcanoes, to the Cotopaxi National Park and onwards to Quito, the world's highest capital.

Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
New Zealand has a lot to offer even the most particular traveller. From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough? Then skydive over Auckland, go white water rafting down Kaituna River or take a leap of faith and bungee jump in Queenstown! When you're in New Zealand, nearly ever adventure is only a stone's throw away. 

Make the most out of your visit to this remote island nation by assembling your bucket list with our travel guide. Booking a tour will ensure your trip is fun, flawless and stress-free: 
http://www.tourradar.com/d/new-zealand

New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries. 

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: http://www.newzealand.com/

---About New Zealand---

New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep. 

The country is divided into two portions: the North and South Islands separated by the Cook Strait. The North Island is home to many hot springs and geysers while the South Island is mountainous, forested and covered in glaciers. Over 75% of New Zealanders call the North Island home, and more than 15% of New Zealand's energy comes from renewable resources.

-u8L3Q0bz8o,Things To Do in Vienna : 3-Day Travel Guide,"Vienna (or Wien, as it is known within most of Europe) is one of the most glamorous cities in the entire world thanks to it being the capital city of the Austrian State for hundreds of years and it's rich history of arts and culture. 

In this video, we will share a 3-day travel guide on how we explored the city of Vienna during our second video. In this video, we cover the Vienna State Opera House, Schonbrunn Palace, Hofburg Palace, The Austrian National Library, Cafe Central, Prater, and more. 

Vienna is packed with so many great sites, museums, and food. While we did manage to pack a lot within our three days it means that we did have to leave some things out. We hope that this guide will help inspire and give you ideas about your next possible trip to Vienna.

9pfEQCBAP-Q,Barcelona (Spain) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 2.975 Hotels in Barcelona - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2tnZ2Tf

Travel video about destination Barcelona in Spain.
Barcelona is one of the most lively harbor cities on the Mediterranean and after Madrid, Spain's second largest city and the capital of Catalonia. Intimate squares, small palaces and tangled alleys provide a good insight into its history as Iberians, Greeks and Romans once had trading posts there.

La Rambla is a wide and shady boulevard that travels through the old town to the harbor and is where life goes on both night and day. It's also where street artists perform, shoeblacks work diligently and portrait painters tout for trade among the passing tourists.

The Museu Mar√≠tim is situated in the royal dockyards of Drassanes, that were built when the city was at its zenith. Its buildings are unique examples of Gothic architecture and the vast dimensions of the dockyard allowed 30 ships to be built simultaneously in the name of the Catalonian-Aragon crown.

Few parks are as famous as the Park G√ºell. With this, Antoni Gaudi created a new design concept in this fabulous garden city. At its entrance, Gaudi placed a colorful lizard as a symbol of the water that is collected in subterranean cisterns and is used for the distribution of water in the park. The city itself is also featured in Gaudi's magnificent fantasies. The Palau G√ºell was treated to an ostentatious roof with a great array of air shafts and chimneys. But the sight that captures the imagination of most who see it is the amazing fa√ßade of the Casa Mila, a unique apartment block without equal. Not a single wall is straight, glass and plaster were used for its fa√ßade and colourful ornamental ceramics complete the work.

Barcelona is a melting pot that ranges from Gothic to Modernism, a veritable explosion of joie de vivre and creativity.

Ys_hUIPta3U,Vanuatu Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/Vanuatu.d192.Destination-Travel-Guides

The Republic of Vanuatu lies in the South Pacific Ocean, just a short flight from Australia and New Zealand. 
 
Most visitors to Vanuatu arrive at the nation‚Äôs capital, Port Vila, situated on the main island of Efate. Vila, as it‚Äôs affectionately known, sits at the edge of a magnificent natural harbor filled with corals and sea life. 
 
Like many South Pacific ports, Vila is wonderfully relaxed, so leave your designer gear at home, pull on some flip flops and slide into island time. 
 
Just a ten-minute drive from port Vila, is Ekasup Cultural Village, where proud villagers are waiting to share their centuries-old customs, crafts, music and stories. 
 
From Vila, take a 50-minute flight to Espiritu Santo. At the island‚Äôs sleepy capital Luganville, stock up on supplies at the markets, before venturing off to explore the island‚Äôs natural wonders. 
 
After exploring mainland Santo, visit the islands off its southern coast, such as Aore Island,  Bokissa Island and Malo Island. 
 
Just a 45-minute flight south from Port Vila, Tanna Island is fringed with beaches ranging from pure white to black volcanic sands. Many of the hillside villages on Tanna remain largely unaffected by the trappings of the modern world. Feel the earth shake on Mt. Yasur, one of the world‚Äôs most active and accessible volcanoes. 
 
After experiencing the warmth and generosity of Vanuatu‚Äôs people, it‚Äôs easy to feel that Vanuatu could be one of richest places on earth.",travel

p0iehiwf228,Ethiopia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Ethiopia.
Ethiopia is a mysterious, mountainous land in the Horn Of Africa and birthplace of Early Christianity.  A country of rock churches in the north and a large variety of tribes along the Rift Valley in the south and the oldest civilised region in Africa with more than twenty five centuries of documented history. Addis Abeba is the capital of Ethiopia and within its centre is the lavishly furnished Menbere Selassie Church, final place of rest of Ethiopia‚Äôs last royal family.  It contains the Empress Menen, two princes and Emperor Haile Selassie who, shortly after removal from power, died due to reasons that are in the main controversial. On many of its thirty seven islands, Lake Tana in Northern Ethiopia is well known for its ancient churches and monasteries.  Dega Stefanos is located in the centre of the lake and contains one of the country‚Äôs most important monasteries.  On the summit, framed by walls and hidden under great trees, is the Holy Stefanos Monastery and within a small sanctuary various mummies are preserved within glazed wooden coffins and the remains of five emperors of various dynasties lie at rest. Awash is a settlement on the edge of the nature park of the same name, inhabited by the Afar, a proud and independent tribe.  On market day, people from the surrounding area meet here.  For the Afar, life is hard and only the strong survive.  Corn, tobacco, dates and cotton are the main trading products of this region.  Dromedaries, sheep and goats are bred, and pastureland is often the subject of heated disputes. A journey through Ethiopia is also a journey through time itself.  A land of rich traditions, religions and myths.  A country of legends and contrast that possesses one of the most colourful histories on the African continent.

From taking someone's reserved seat to brining stinky food onto a train. Here are our six unwritten rules of European train travel.

3. Only bring luggage that you can carry yourself
4. Don't bring stinky food onto the train 
5. Let people off the train before you try to board the train

LjOAE6FFVTo,Is Time Travel Possible?,"Is Time Travel Possible?
Subscribe: https://goo.gl/GmtyPv

Everyone has thought about time travel at least once in their life. Maybe you‚Äôve wanted to go back in time and try to change something from your past. There‚Äôs even a lot of science fiction movies out there that involve time travel, or were inspired by time travel in some way or another. But is it really possible to travel back or forward in time? And if it really is possible, what would we have to do in order to make time travel a reality? 

The very thought about time travel and what it would take to make it a reality is mind-boggling. It is something that scientists, especially astrophysicists, have long thought about. The most fantastic thing? It's probably possible. We should probably start off with the bad news about time travel. We probably can‚Äôt travel back in time and watch the Egyptians build the pyramids. However, there are a number of theories that have suggested that it is possible to take a leap forward in time. But going back in time is far more complicated. That‚Äôs not saying it‚Äôs impossible though. 

The great 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. While most people think of time as a constant, Einstein showed that time is an illusion; it is relative in that it can vary for different observers depending on your speed through space. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life, but other scientists have confirmed this theory. The theory says that space and time are really aspects of the same thing which is called ‚Äòspace-time‚Äô. There is a speed limit of 300,000 kilometers per second (or 186,000 miles per second) for anything that travels through space-time, and light always travels this speed limit through empty space. 

So more about this illusion of time, ‚ÄòSpecial Relativity‚Äô says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, especially when your speed relative to other objects is close to the speed of light. Time goes slower for you than for the people you left behind. You won't notice this effect until you return to those stationary people. 

So as an experiment, let‚Äôs say you were 15 years old and you left Earth in a spacecraft traveling at about close to the speed of light, and you celebrated only five birthdays during your space voyage. When you got home at the age of 20, you would find that all your classmates who were the same age as you when you left were 65 years old, retired, and hanging out with their grandchildren! The reason for this is because as time passed more slowly for you, you would have experienced only five years of life, while your classmates will have experienced a full 50 years.",travel
YXz-erPr8B8,Montevideo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Uruguay is emerging as one of South America‚Äôs favorite destinations. Its capital Montevideo has a warm, temperate climate, pleasant sea breezes and miles of boulevards.

From Montevideo‚Äôs Telecommunications Tower you can see the hill that gave the city its name.

Another tower, the Palacio Salvo looms high above the Plaza Independencia in the City Center. Under this square is the mausoleum for the country‚Äôs revolutionary hero Jos√© Artigas.

Nearby Plaza Matriz is the city‚Äôs oldest square and home to the 18th-century Metropolitan Cathedral, the focal point of Uruguay‚Äôs Old Town.

Soccer is big here and in 1930 Uruguay hosted and won the first-ever FIFA World Cup in the Estadio Centenario.

Another proud local tradition is ‚Äúparrilla"" and the best way to try it is to buy cuts of meat in the Mercado del Puerto, and have those cooked for you on the spot.

The 19-mile long promenade, La Rambla leads to the city‚Äôs favorite playground: De Los Pocitos Beach.

To the west along the river is the UNESCO-listed Old Town of Colonia del Sacramento, with its landmark lighthouse, sleepy Plaza de Armas, historic Port√≥n de Campo and atmospheric Street of Sighs.

To the east of Montevideo, if you follow the coast, is Piri√°polis. This beach resort offers great views from its hilltop San Antonio Temple. 

The next highlight on this road trip is the lighthouse of La Paloma on the Cabo de Santa Mar√≠a peninsula.
On your way to the lighthouse of Punta del Este, don‚Äôt miss eccentric Casapueblo, a wonderful hotel and art gallery designed by local artist Carlos P√°ez Vilar√≥ in Punta Ballena.

Uruguay may be small, but its big heart and relaxing vibe create a lifetime of memories.

-KMZW_zwRfc,San Diego Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/San-Diego.d178304.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to San Diego, often called the birthplace of California.

Start your San Diego tour with a stop in Old Town, a historic park filled with buildings dating back to the 1820s. If you want something a little livelier, go a few miles south to check out the Gaslamp District, full of Victorian-era architecture and a thriving bar and club scene. Bringing the kids with you, or looking for a more sedate afternoon? Stop by the San Diego Zoo and spend some time with the many animals taking up residence there ‚Äì including some of the few pandas outside of China.

Explore San Diego‚Äôs ties to the sea by touring the U.S.S. Midway, Navy Pier, and Maritime Museum. From there, it‚Äôs just a skip across the bay to Coronado, where you can lay out in the sun and soak up some rays in a quiet beach town. 

Round out your day with a trip to ‚Äúthe jewel,‚Äù better known as La Jolla, and indulge in some of the best seafood and Mexican food you‚Äôll find anywhere. Don‚Äôt forget to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù to the sea lions.

Banff, located in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies, is one part resort town and one part breathtaking natural retreat.

Life is a little different at over 4,600 feet in elevation‚Äîby the way, that makes Banff Canada‚Äôs highest town. During your Banff sightseeing, you‚Äôll learn that the town‚Äôs residents and visitors are a lively bunch, and you‚Äôll find the local businesses are perfect for this festive crowd. Choose from over 100 restaurants to dine at, or stop by one or two of the dozens of pubs and cafes for an inexpensive snack and drink after walking through the many boutiques. You can also enjoy a marvelous time after the sun goes down; try dancing the night away at the Dancing Sasquatch, or visiting one of Banff‚Äôs other nightclubs. 

Banff National Park is known for its wildlife, some of which frequents Banff itself. You‚Äôll often spot deer at the outskirts of town, some of which are friendly and curious about people. Once you say hello to the deer, make the drive to nearby Johnston Canyon, where you can take in snow-capped alpine scenery straight out of a fairy tale. 

Warm up after all this time spent outside: head to the Banff Upper Hot Springs. This exquisite spa has treated visitors to hot water and stunning views of the Rockies for over a century, and will continue to do so for a century to come.

What will you do on your Banff tour?

24) U-bahn and S-bahn metro system
25) Turkish Food 

The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining strip of the of the former dividing wall between East and West Berlin. Today the 1.3 kilometer long wall stands as a memorial to freedom and it is covered in art and graffiti. Right now we're visiting Brandenburg Gate.  This gate dates back to the 18th Century. We're here at Tiergarten, one of the biggest parks in the city. MauerPark is a hipster hangout. If you head over to the Bear Pit you can catch some karaoke and musical performances. If you want to spot some cool street art, then head over to Friedrichshain. You can't come to Berlin and not eat a Currywurst! This is the city's most popular fast food snack. The sausage is served with a ketchup and curry powder concoction. Up next we're at the Reichstag building which has a pretty cool glass dome on top.  This dome is actually open to visitors and it offers 360 degree views of the city. Today we're visiting Tempelhof, a re-purposed airport here in Berlin for leisure activities and sports. If you enjoy museums and art galleries you'll want to visit Berlin's Museum Island.  They actually have five different museums here and if you get a daily pass for 18 Euros you get access to all five. We are now visiting the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.  It is also known as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Charlottenburg Palace is the largest palace in Berlin and the only surviving royal residence in the city. Checkpoint Charlie was one of the crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. Located near Alexanderplatz, The Berlin TV Tower offers a great lookout over the city. Chocolate! Ritter Sport is a chocolate brand that is sold all over Germany, and while in Berlin we couldn't resist sampling a few of the different varieties. Berlin Cathedral is located on Museum Island and it's one of the most beautiful churches in the city. If Currywurst is to your liking, you'll want to check out this quirky museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage. Renting a bike is a great way to get around the city. Most places will rent out bikes at 10 Euros per day. For a leisurely afternoon, hop on a boat and enjoy a tour down the River Spree. Of course, you cannot come to Berlin and not eat a Wurst or a sausage. The Friedrichshain flea market takes place every Sunday and it's a great place for people watching and a little browsing. The Germans sure know how to enjoy a hearty breakfast, and we recommend you try it too. 
We couldn't resist visiting yet another cat cafe while we were in Berlin. 
While in Berlin we enjoyed a hearty meal of Schnitzel. It's quite easy to get around Berlin using the U-bahn and S-bahn system. In Berlin, there is a big Turkish population and that means there is awesome Turkish street food.  And that's Berlin for you! A city that has risen from the ashes of the war, which is now bursting with art, music, and life.

jeI3Ni7m46g,China Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination China.
China‚Äôs Imperial City is located in the centre of its ancient Middle Kingdom, a gigantic and inscrutable empire beyond the Great Wall. The Imperial City is entered through the Gates of Heavenly Peace.After seven years of construction, Ming Emperor Zhu Di moved into his newly-established palace complex in which over eight thousand people lived in almost a thousand rooms. The palace served as both a residential and governmental seat to the emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. A stone‚Äôs throw away from the old Summer Palace is the Garden of Harmonious Unity that was the favourite garden of the Emperor‚Äôs household who retreated to its cool lakeside shores during the humid months of summer. Close to Badaling the Great Wall Of China extends majestically across misty mountains. It is the largest Man-made structure in the world and was erected to protect the country from invasion from the North. The gigantic wall represented the division of two very different cultures. On one side the Central Asian Nomads and on the other the highly developed civilisation of the emerging Chinese Empire. Shanghai is a Gigantic City and a meeting point of both east and west. The shoreline is without a doubt the city‚Äôs main focal point and is a combination of past, present and future and contains the historic monuments and eye catching buildings of a great city. Famous explorer Marco Polo referred to Suzhou as the ‚ÄòVenice of the East‚Äô, a city that is particularly famous for its gardens. Many of its extremely elegant buildings are remnants of a glorious past. Yunnan¬¥s most famous site is the unique Stone Forest Of Shi Lin, a forest of rock that extends for 27,000 hectares. Hong Kong is a city of the superlative with glimmering skyscrapers that seem to take root in the sky and one elegant building after another with shining glass and hi-tech facades. China is a world within a world!

AZwGHEYT5x8,Austin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Austin.d178234.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Austin, home to nearly 900,000 people. The capital of Texas attracts a number of young, talented university students, which has prompted a good-natured culture war between the newcomers and the city‚Äôs longtime residents. So far, the latter group seems to be winning, thanks to their dedication to the Keep Austin Weird campaign. You‚Äôll find elements of this movement throughout the city in the shape of various art installations, eclectic eateries, and murals. 
 
An Austin tour means an adventure in the Live Music Capital of the World, home to festivals celebrating all kinds of tunes. Whether you‚Äôre here to listen to blues, country, or a little bit of rockabilly, you‚Äôre bound to find exactly what your musical palette desires in this quirky town. 

Austin is proud of its citizens, and throughout the city you‚Äôll find monuments of ranchers, prominent musicians, and Civil War heroes. Many of these monuments are located in Austin‚Äôs numerous parks, making it an excellent place to get in touch with nature. If relaxing by a fountain seems a little too bohemian for you, visit South Congress Avenue. ‚ÄúSoCo‚Äù is a veritable paradise anyone who loves vintage threads and just the right amount of ‚Äúweird‚Äù that makes Austin unique.

Don‚Äôt worry about keeping yourself fed ‚Äì as you‚Äôll notice in your Austin sightseeing adventure, you‚Äôll find a food truck on every street, and bistros, cafes, and restaurants just waiting for you to dive in and sample their culinary offerings. 

Whether you‚Äôre here for music, food, or to take in the local art scene, you‚Äôll find no shortage of things to do in downtown Austin. Have you been to any of its famous festivals?

vCQE-D6AqNY,10 Essential Travel Packing Tips &amp; Hacks - Minimalist Traveling,"How to Pack Light & Smart - Essential Travel Packing Tips for Minimalist Traveling.  Audible is offering our followers a free 30-day trial today.  Sign up to check out their audio books using our special link: http://www.audible.com/exploringalternatives

Want more travel packing tips?  Check out this NEW video we made for extra light minimalist travel: https://youtu.be/-PcrLWkxZSk  

After almost 5 years of travelling, we've come up with our 10 best travel packing tips to help you travel light, save money, and have an easy and comfortable trip.

1. Minimalist Travel Wardrobe

We choose clothes that are all in the same colour scheme and style so they can be layered to create different outfits for different situations and climates. In our experience, packing fewer clothes is always best and if you find that you're missing something, like a warmer sweater, you can always pick it up along the way.

2. Water

After buying and throwing out countless plastic water bottles on our travels, we finally said enough is enough.  It was a waste of money and plastic.  So we decided to get a portable water purifier (SteriPEN sent us one) and now we bring our own stainless steel water bottles with us and we purify tap water wherever we are.

3. Books and Guides

Books and guides are easily the heaviest things we carry on trips.  To downsize the weight in our backpack or suitcase, we try to bring smaller travel journals, we don't bring guide books (we use our iPod and free maps from airports and train stations to get around), and we're starting to try eBooks (free from the library) and audio books from Audible (our video sponsor!).

4. Staying Clean

When travelling, there are many times (for us at least) when we don't shower as often as we'd like, maybe a long 48 hour travel leg, or a nasty hostel shower that we don't want to use.  To stay fresh between showers, we use dry shampoo (the one in the video is from One Love Organics) and wet wipes (paraben-free).  We also always travel with Dr Bronners soap because we can use it for everything: showering, dishes, and laundry.

5. Souvenirs

We no longer buy souvenirs for our friends and family.  Instead, we try to send postcards to show people we're thinking of them.  It's cheaper, less wasteful, and we feel that it's more meaningful overall.

6. Passports

We've had a passport stolen, and another damaged by water.  We're not messing around with our passports anymore so we carry them in ziplock bags, inside a hidden passport pouch.

7. Food and Snacks

Food and snacks at airports and in touristy areas is usually overpriced and not necessarily healthy.  We try to pack our own food and snacks as much as possible (sandwiches, granola bars, hummus and crackers, oatmeal, roasted nuts, etc.) but it's important to check the rules about what you can bring and where.  

8. Electronics

When we're not travelling for work, we try to bring just our iPod touch.  We travelled for almost one full year with just the iPod & free wifi, and we did all of our hotel and flight bookings, and even a couple of visa applications on the tiny screen.  It's not perfect, but it saves us from lugging around a couple of laptops like we do now.

We also always travel with a flashlight. We have a Foxelli headlamp that is USB rechargeable and the battery lasts forever (they sent us the headlamp a couple of years ago and we love it).

9. Reusables

Travel has a pretty big environmental footprint and while we haven't quite gotten to the point where we're willing to stop just for environmental reasons, we do try to minimize flying and we travel with reusable containers to limit the amount of garbage waste we're producing.  We bring stainless steel food containers (by Onyx), water bottles, and coffee mugs, as well as cloth bags and cutlery.

10. Staying Healthy

We use natural remedies like oregano oil, garlic pills, activated charcoal, and essential oils to treat things like food poisoning, cold and flu, diarrhea, headaches, etc.  We also bring strong anti-nausea pills because Danielle gets motion sick in cars, planes, buses ‚Äî even a hammock once!

Thanks for watching!

GEFB4s4NrPw,Is time travel possible? Brian Cox and Nalini Joshi offer their views | Q &amp; A,"A questioner on ABC's Q&A asks whether it is possible for a person who invents a time machine in the future to travel back in time and show us how to make one. Panelists Nalini Joshi and Professor Brian Cox give their views.

More science here: https://www.youtube.com/user/ABCTVCatalyst

More Q&A here: https://www.youtube.com/user/abcqanda

Brian Cox says you can't travel into the past, but Nalini Joshi disagrees.

""Well, I don't know about whether there's an arrow that prevents you from going to the past or only into the future but, mathematically, I think that there are many, many possible answers to these questions. If I may? You know, if you take just a three dimensional cube and you look at one corner of this three-dimensional cube and then you compress one corner down to the diagonally opposite corner, then what you do is you flatten the cube and it becomes a hexagon. If you take that structure, which is hexagonally symmetric, it turns out that these types of symmetries are in crystals and there are a very knew few number of these regular symmetries that are exhibited in crystals in two dimensions. Now, if you think about increasing the number of dimensions, now go to three, four, five, six, presto, around 7 and 8 there are exceptional new structures that come up, that only exist when you get to 7 and 8 and maybe 9 dimensions.""",travel

For the second part of this track, we have formulated another set of frequencies dedicated for a deep, sound sleep and relaxation. Both parts contain the frequency of the Sun, 136.1Hz, which resonates the feelings of calmness, meditative, and centering. It is also connected to the Heart chakra to give you a sense of balance and harmony with the cosmos. As you finish your astral travels, you will find yourself falling into deep sleep and waking up feeling refreshed and energized.

One tip on how to do an astral projection is to repeat this phrase, ""Mind awake, Body asleep."" Let your body fall into slumber. It will feel numb and heavy at the same time. Do not be afraid of strange new sensations. For more tips on astral projection, read our blog:

hVfBQNENS9s,Berlin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Welcome to Berlin, the capital city of Germany.

The first documentation of Berlin appears in the 13th century, and it has a long history of importance‚Äîit‚Äôs been the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Kingdom of Prussia, among others. The lengthy history encompassing the city often manifests in its eclectic collection of architecture, which you should certainly include on your Berlin tour.

From the towering classical lines of Charlottenburg Palace, built for the Hohenzollern family in the 17th century, to the sleek mirrored sides of the Bahn Tower, you‚Äôre bound to find plenty to look at in the city‚Äôs downtown area. Fancy a real German lager? Stop by Prater Garten for a brew‚Äîbuilt in 1837, it‚Äôs one of the handful of buildings that has survived both World Wars. You can sit outside and responsibly enjoy your drink, or, if the weather turns on you, head inside to enjoy a hearty German meal. 

Ready to check out the rest of the city? You‚Äôre in luck. Berlin sightseeing is easy: Though the sprawling city has excellent public transit, Berlin is geared toward pedestrians, and you can access much of the city center on food or by bicycle. For a truly extraordinary experience, visit Museum Island, located in the Spree River. It features five museums, among them the Altes, completed in 1830 and devoted to antiquities. The newest structure on the premises, built in 1930, is the Pergamon Museum. Here you can explore the art of numerous cultures, or wander through a replica of the Ishtar Gate. 

Are you one of those people who only starts to wake up after the sun goes down? If you‚Äôre looking for a thriving nightlife, Berlin is the place to go. When the sun sets on the city, the party really begins, and you can find any number of clubs where you can dance until long after the sun comes up. 

Where will you go in Berlin?

Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.

20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.

So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.

Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.

For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.

So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.

The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.

Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city‚Äôs canal system.

Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. 

So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.

And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.

owI1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180020.Destination-Travel-Guides

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg‚Äôs fairytale setting.
¬†
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and¬†provided the settings for one of cinema‚Äôs most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
¬†¬†
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe‚Äôs best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you‚Äôll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
¬†
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf√© Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M√ºllner Br√§u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world.¬†
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg‚Äôs southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
¬†
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city‚Äôs most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe‚Äôs highest suspension bridge.
¬†
The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",travel

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",travel

nD_dFyfOXIo,Patagonia Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Travel to the land that time forgot and set out on the journey of a lifetime in Patagonia, where Mother Nature runs the show. 

Patagonia, the fabled ‚Äòedge of the world‚Äô, spans the southernmost regions of Chile and Argentina and can be rugged and desolate as well as breathtakingly beautiful and inviting.

This last frontier of South America is a colorful mosaic of snow-capped mountains,  icebergs, volcanoes, glaciers, forests, lakes and vast steppe plains.

On the Argentinean side, the scenic Road of the 7 Lakes takes you from San Mart√≠n de los Andes to Villa La Angostura and finally San Carlos de Bariloche, a popular ski resort on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi.

El Chalt√©n, in the southern Andes, is Argentina‚Äôs trekking capital. Trails lead to Laguna Capri, Fitz Roy Mountain and the fearsome Cerro Torre.

El Calafate is nestled the southern shores of Lago Argentino and is the gateway lake to Los Glaciares National Park. Here, one of the world‚Äôs most awe-inspiring glaciers awaits: the Perito Moreno Glacier.

In the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia, take the 'End of the World Train‚Äô to Tierra del Fuego National Park or get there by boat over the Beagle Channel. Photo opportunities along the way include Bird Island, Seal Island and the historic Les √âclaireurs lighthouse.

On the Chilean side of Patagonia, the regional capital Punta Arenas attracts visitors with its colonial architecture, cultural attractions and hospitality.

Tour the region‚Äôs Milod√≥n Cave, where the remains of a giant ground-dwelling sloth and other huge extinct species were found.

Torres del Paine National Park is great for horse riding or hiking, with its steppes, snowcapped peaks, brimming lakes and Salto Grande waterfalls.

On the northern border of Chilean Patagonia, in the Los Lagos region, looms the mighty Osorno Volcano. The town of Puerto Varas, on the opposite shores of Lake Llanquihue, marks the end your Patagonia expedition.

Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì it also has an entire section devoted to creatures of dry land, so make sure you check out the Jungle Walk. You can also scream your way through over 100 rides at Six Flags, or explore the history of the cowboy way at Pioneer Plaza.

A fine Texas day comes to an end with steak, dancing, and mingling with friendly locals who have hearts as big as the state itself.

A trip to London might as well be a trip through history. This city has long been a hub for finance, education, and culture, and is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings. 

Your London tour must include St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. You‚Äôll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the city‚Äôs famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London sightseeing in the West End, where you‚Äôll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. You‚Äôll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week. 

For a real treat, climb aboard the London Eye, a giant, rotating Ferris wheel, and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

idg6vW3vXtE,Prague Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Prague.d180014.Destination-Travel-Guides

Step into a child‚Äôs storybook when you first arrive in Prague, a city in the Czech Republic where sleek, modern buildings share space with ancient gothic architecture. Wander down the twisting cobblestone streets ‚Äì you‚Äôre sure to find something new and exciting. After all, even locals get lost here.

Prague tourism usually involves the Royal Route, a historic coronation path that will take you through Old Town. Walk a few blocks to Old Town Square and sample local street fare in the shadow of old castles and palaces. Old Town itself is full of cafes, restaurants, and galleries, and will provide days of exploration for intrepid visitors.

Cross over the Charles Bridge and climb up to Prague Castle, a network of palaces, churches, and numerous museums. Be careful, as folks were a lot shorter back then ‚Äì you may have to duck your head as you walk through the low-ceilinged, artifact-filled halls.

Your Prague sightseeing must pause at St. Vitus Cathedral, a massive gothic structure dating back 600 years. You‚Äôll have to arch your back to see over 300 feet to the ceilings, which seem to vanish into the heavens. By the time you‚Äôre back outside, it will likely be twilight. You‚Äôll see pigs roasting on spits and people gathered under the statue of St. Wenceslas to share their daily adventures. The people here are friendly, so why not join them and chime in with your own stories?

Have you been to Prague? What would you like to do while there?

Following is the transcript of the video:

Brian Greene: I‚Äôm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.

It's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.

We know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It‚Äôs surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.

He also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity ‚Äî a neutron star, a black hole ‚Äî and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.

This is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel ‚Äî to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.

The main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really ‚Ä¶ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.

It's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole ‚Äî put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey ‚Äî then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel ‚Äî through this wormhole ‚Äî you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.

Now again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.",travel

Time Travel Explained | Did Gautama Buddha Time Travel ? | Sadhguru | Adiyogi

Sadhguru relates time travel to instances of people who don't have control over their imaginations. Instead, he discusses the concept of creation of bodies periodically through time. The experience of time and how life experiences time is very different. There are multiple perspectives of time that one must consider when questioning time travel.

Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. An arresting blend of profundity and pragmatism, his life and work serves as a reminder that yoga is a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.

Banff, located in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies, is one part resort town and one part breathtaking natural retreat.

Life is a little different at over 4,600 feet in elevation‚Äîby the way, that makes Banff Canada‚Äôs highest town. During your Banff sightseeing, you‚Äôll learn that the town‚Äôs residents and visitors are a lively bunch, and you‚Äôll find the local businesses are perfect for this festive crowd. Choose from over 100 restaurants to dine at, or stop by one or two of the dozens of pubs and cafes for an inexpensive snack and drink after walking through the many boutiques. You can also enjoy a marvelous time after the sun goes down; try dancing the night away at the Dancing Sasquatch, or visiting one of Banff‚Äôs other nightclubs. 

Banff National Park is known for its wildlife, some of which frequents Banff itself. You‚Äôll often spot deer at the outskirts of town, some of which are friendly and curious about people. Once you say hello to the deer, make the drive to nearby Johnston Canyon, where you can take in snow-capped alpine scenery straight out of a fairy tale. 

Warm up after all this time spent outside: head to the Banff Upper Hot Springs. This exquisite spa has treated visitors to hot water and stunning views of the Rockies for over a century, and will continue to do so for a century to come.

What will you do on your Banff tour?

All I need to travel to a new universe is do something? Great! According to quantum immortality, the way to leap into a parallel universe is simple; you need to die.

nD_dFyfOXIo,Patagonia Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Travel to the land that time forgot and set out on the journey of a lifetime in Patagonia, where Mother Nature runs the show. 

Patagonia, the fabled ‚Äòedge of the world‚Äô, spans the southernmost regions of Chile and Argentina and can be rugged and desolate as well as breathtakingly beautiful and inviting.

This last frontier of South America is a colorful mosaic of snow-capped mountains,  icebergs, volcanoes, glaciers, forests, lakes and vast steppe plains.

On the Argentinean side, the scenic Road of the 7 Lakes takes you from San Mart√≠n de los Andes to Villa La Angostura and finally San Carlos de Bariloche, a popular ski resort on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi.

El Chalt√©n, in the southern Andes, is Argentina‚Äôs trekking capital. Trails lead to Laguna Capri, Fitz Roy Mountain and the fearsome Cerro Torre.

El Calafate is nestled the southern shores of Lago Argentino and is the gateway lake to Los Glaciares National Park. Here, one of the world‚Äôs most awe-inspiring glaciers awaits: the Perito Moreno Glacier.

In the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia, take the 'End of the World Train‚Äô to Tierra del Fuego National Park or get there by boat over the Beagle Channel. Photo opportunities along the way include Bird Island, Seal Island and the historic Les √âclaireurs lighthouse.

On the Chilean side of Patagonia, the regional capital Punta Arenas attracts visitors with its colonial architecture, cultural attractions and hospitality.

Tour the region‚Äôs Milod√≥n Cave, where the remains of a giant ground-dwelling sloth and other huge extinct species were found.

Torres del Paine National Park is great for horse riding or hiking, with its steppes, snowcapped peaks, brimming lakes and Salto Grande waterfalls.

On the northern border of Chilean Patagonia, in the Los Lagos region, looms the mighty Osorno Volcano. The town of Puerto Varas, on the opposite shores of Lake Llanquihue, marks the end your Patagonia expedition.

hVfBQNENS9s,Berlin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Welcome to Berlin, the capital city of Germany.

The first documentation of Berlin appears in the 13th century, and it has a long history of importance‚Äîit‚Äôs been the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Kingdom of Prussia, among others. The lengthy history encompassing the city often manifests in its eclectic collection of architecture, which you should certainly include on your Berlin tour.

From the towering classical lines of Charlottenburg Palace, built for the Hohenzollern family in the 17th century, to the sleek mirrored sides of the Bahn Tower, you‚Äôre bound to find plenty to look at in the city‚Äôs downtown area. Fancy a real German lager? Stop by Prater Garten for a brew‚Äîbuilt in 1837, it‚Äôs one of the handful of buildings that has survived both World Wars. You can sit outside and responsibly enjoy your drink, or, if the weather turns on you, head inside to enjoy a hearty German meal. 

Ready to check out the rest of the city? You‚Äôre in luck. Berlin sightseeing is easy: Though the sprawling city has excellent public transit, Berlin is geared toward pedestrians, and you can access much of the city center on food or by bicycle. For a truly extraordinary experience, visit Museum Island, located in the Spree River. It features five museums, among them the Altes, completed in 1830 and devoted to antiquities. The newest structure on the premises, built in 1930, is the Pergamon Museum. Here you can explore the art of numerous cultures, or wander through a replica of the Ishtar Gate. 

Are you one of those people who only starts to wake up after the sun goes down? If you‚Äôre looking for a thriving nightlife, Berlin is the place to go. When the sun sets on the city, the party really begins, and you can find any number of clubs where you can dance until long after the sun comes up. 

Where will you go in Berlin?

qfUE8xQ_SgE,Los Angeles Travel Tips: 13 Things to Know Before You Go to LA,"Things you need to know before you travel to Los Angeles California.  LA is HUGE. You won't be able to see all of LA, unless you're staying for a very very long time. Los Angeles doesn't have a ""center"" and Downtown LA is not very exciting. LA is comprised of multiple cities Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Malibu. Get a rental car - You'll need it to see most tourist attractions in Los Angeles.
2.  Traffic
 - LA has traffic everywhere, all the time.  All day, every day.  Yes, even at 1am on a weekend.  Deal with it.
 - The freeways have names -- it's not I-405 -- it's ""THE 405""
3. Public Transit
 - LA has a subway!
 - But it probably doesn't go where you want!  Especially the beach!
4. Parking
 - Is often Valet
 - and Costs money everywhere
 - Except when you're parking on the freeway :)
 - Pay attention to street signs (confusing times and days)
5. Navigation
 - Know where you're going and take the correct exit
 - Take the wrong exit and you might end up in some place really sketchy
 - Lots of little cities, the street numbering changes in different cities
6. Weather
 - LA is not always sunny and warm
 - It gets cold -- particularly at night
 - Shorts in the day, but pants and a jacket at night
 - And the ocean water is cold too... 70 degrees is as warm as it gets
 - Inland can be 30 degrees warmer than the beach
 - Lots of sunscreen
 - Sunglasses
 - It's dry -- moisturizer
7. LA is unlike the rest of California
 - It can feel like a different country, or at least a different state
 - Venice Beach in particular
8. Hollywood is in the neighborhood called ""Hollywood""
 - West Hollywood is in front of the Hollywood sign (and a different city) with Fancy homes
 - East Hollywood doesn't have much
 - North Hollywood over the mountain is a suburb of LA
 - Oh by the way -- no actors in Hollywood
 - And if you go see a 30 minute sitcom taping it will take 4+ hours
9. The Valley
 - Means San Fernando Valley
 - Burbank, Studio City, North Hollywood, Van Nuys
10. LA's most well known attractions are also some of the most rundown
 - Hollywood Boulevard or is Tijuana?
 - Venice Beach, oh my lord
11. LA is casual
 - Flip flops and shorts are OK except in the most dressy establishments
12. Bring your own shopping bag
 - Supermarkets charge 10 cents for shopping bags in California
13. Mexican Food in LA is awesome
 - Get some fish tacos!
 - And visit King Taco!

Following is the transcript of the video:

Brian Greene: I‚Äôm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.

It's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.

We know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It‚Äôs surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.

He also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity ‚Äî a neutron star, a black hole ‚Äî and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.

This is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel ‚Äî to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.

The main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really ‚Ä¶ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.

It's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole ‚Äî put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey ‚Äî then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel ‚Äî through this wormhole ‚Äî you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.

Now again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.",travel

Transcript:

Welcome to Lisbon!

Lisbon is Portugal's unassumingly cool capital and western Europe's oldest city that serves over 12 million tourists every year. Way back in 1755 the city was hit by a huge earthquake that destroyed 85% of¬†buildings. The city had no choice but to rebuild itself and the 18th century architecture that reshaped Lisbon is still very dominant today. In fact if you come here, don‚Äôt be surprised to spend most of your time looking up and admiring it as you wander through the fairy tale cobbled streets lined with iconic Portuguese tiles that have inspired artists for generations. Each building and street really does have its own personality.¬†What‚Äôs more, amongst this wealth of history, is an eclectic city renowned for having colourful nightlife, tonnes of culture, music and a cosmopolitan food scene that modestly boasts the best custard tarts on the planet! This city break is ideal all year round, with temperatures rarely going below 10 degrees celsius in the winter and averaging 25 in the summer. It really does seem like Lisbon has it all, and we're here to show you why‚Ä¶

Coming up we‚Äôre going to take you through our top tips for 48 hours in Lisbon. From transport, things to do, places to see, lingo, and where to buy the best custard tarts in the city. We‚Äôve done the research to save you time and help you have the most amazing trip. So let‚Äôs start with how to get here.

The flight from London Gatwick takes just over 2 and a half hours straight into Lisbon‚Äôs only airport which is conveniently just 7km from the heart of the city. 

The best thing about Lisbon Airport is it‚Äôs only a 20 minute drive into the city centre. The easiest way to get in is to jump in a taxi or take the Aerobus. There are two lines running into the main hotel areas that cost ‚Ç¨4 per person each way. 

Alternatively you could take the metro that runs from 6am to 1am everyday or there‚Äôs always the city bus but do expect for both these options to take a little longer. 

Lisbon is known as the city of seven hills so to save your legs from all that climbing you‚Äôll probably gonna want to use public transport at some point. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to get around the city - from train, tram, metro, bus and even funicular lift.

The metro is good choice if you‚Äôre traveling long distances but doesn‚Äôt cover all areas of the city. It‚Äôs one of cleanest metros in Europe, and most stations are open from 6am to 1am every day. 

Trams cover areas of the city where there is no access to the metro. There are two types of trams, the yellow ‚ÄúRemodelado‚Äù trams that route round the old narrow streets and then there‚Äôs modern ‚ÄúArticulado‚Äù trams that operate along the flat sections of the city connecting central Lisbon to the Belem district.

Lisbon has hundreds of buses and 88 different routes so you‚Äôre bound to find one to take you where you need to go. 

The funicular lifts are used to help locals and tourists climb all those hills. The most famous lift is the Santa Justa Lift linking lower and upper Lisbon. Yes, it‚Äôs technically a means of public transport ¬†but it also doubles up a a major tourist attraction and has great a view point at the top. 

We noticed a lot of tourists jumping in Tuk Tuks, and so we thought we‚Äôd give it a go. But it turns out the cobbled streets of Lisbon don‚Äôt make for a comfy ride in a Tuk Tuk, and if I‚Äôm honest a 5 minute ride was a bit of a rip off at ‚Ç¨15.

Working out the best way to pay for transport in Lisbon can get confusing‚Ä¶ so here‚Äôs our simple breakdown‚Ä¶",travel
xoDarajuEjE,Sikkim and Bhutan (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Sikkim and Bhutan.
Surrounded by the world‚Äôs highest mountains is a fascinating world whose exotic charm enchants all who experience it, from the plains of West Bengal up into the Himalayas. Siliguri is a vibrant city located within India‚Äôs Terai Plain, a peaceful provincial town with calm streets and shops that once supplied the region‚Äôs tea pickers with their daily needs, has been transformed into an important crossroads for travellers to the Himalayas. Siliguri Train Station is the starting point of one of the most famous train journeys in the world, the Darjeeling Himalaya Toy Train which climbs to an altitude of more than two thousand metres, negotiates eight hundred and seventy three bends and crosses more than five hundred bridges. Sikkim is strongly associated with Tibet and possesses more than two hundred monasteries.  The most holy monastery of the Nyingmapa Schools is in Tashiding and is located on a mountain in the east of the country along the route from Darjeeling. The independent kingdom of Bhutan is located in Southeast Asia, most of it being two thousand metres above sea level and is situated between India in the south and Tibet in the north.  Thimphu is the capital of Bhutan.  An array of prayer flags adorn a bridge in the centre of the city and close by is the large Tshonhkhang Marketplace, a colourful meeting place for both farmers and traders. For more than a thousand years Bhutan has survived in self-imposed isolation, cut off from the outside world by its own deliberate policy. Sikkim and Bhutan:  two gems of history, monastic culture and religious life.

A trip to London might as well be a trip through history. This city has long been a hub for finance, education, and culture, and is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings. 

Your London tour must include St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. You‚Äôll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the city‚Äôs famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London sightseeing in the West End, where you‚Äôll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. You‚Äôll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week. 

For a real treat, climb aboard the London Eye, a giant, rotating Ferris wheel, and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

Your professor has accidentally stepped through a time portal in his physics lab. You‚Äôve got just a minute to jump through before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Your only way back is to grab enough colored nodules to create a new portal to open a doorway through time. Can you take the right amount of nodules to get back to the present before the portal closes? Dan Finkel shows how.

idg6vW3vXtE,Prague Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Prague.d180014.Destination-Travel-Guides

Step into a child‚Äôs storybook when you first arrive in Prague, a city in the Czech Republic where sleek, modern buildings share space with ancient gothic architecture. Wander down the twisting cobblestone streets ‚Äì you‚Äôre sure to find something new and exciting. After all, even locals get lost here.

Prague tourism usually involves the Royal Route, a historic coronation path that will take you through Old Town. Walk a few blocks to Old Town Square and sample local street fare in the shadow of old castles and palaces. Old Town itself is full of cafes, restaurants, and galleries, and will provide days of exploration for intrepid visitors.

Cross over the Charles Bridge and climb up to Prague Castle, a network of palaces, churches, and numerous museums. Be careful, as folks were a lot shorter back then ‚Äì you may have to duck your head as you walk through the low-ceilinged, artifact-filled halls.

Your Prague sightseeing must pause at St. Vitus Cathedral, a massive gothic structure dating back 600 years. You‚Äôll have to arch your back to see over 300 feet to the ceilings, which seem to vanish into the heavens. By the time you‚Äôre back outside, it will likely be twilight. You‚Äôll see pigs roasting on spits and people gathered under the statue of St. Wenceslas to share their daily adventures. The people here are friendly, so why not join them and chime in with your own stories?

Have you been to Prague? What would you like to do while there?

iZZJ1wLmmr8,Syracuse Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Siracusa in Italy.
The sea has always been of great importance to the city of Siracusa. Greek colonialists first arrived here by boat and settled in Sicily and thus laid the foundations of the region‚Äôs future prosperity. The attractive historic centre of the old town is located on the island of Ortygia whose buildings contain almost two thousand seven hundred years of history. When under the dictatorship of the tyrant, Dionysios The First, the town had a population of half a million that even surpassed that of Athens. Following a two year siege in 212 B.C. the Romans succeeded in conquering the metropolis. The Teatro Greco is one of the most beautiful amphitheatres of Ancient Greece and at the beginning of the fifth century dramas and comedies were frequently performed there. It once accommodated up to fifteen thousand spectators. Numerous colourful legends abound of the nearby Ear of Dionysios. The grotto is a wonder of acoustics in which even the most gentle whisper can be heard. Legend has it that the tyrant Dionysios used the phenomenon to eavesdrop on his prisoners. Siracusa is a fascinating and atmospheric place, steeped in history, myth and legend.

pnN2BNrSrXY,Moscow Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Your trip to Moscow, Russia is bound to be a special one. From the multicolored spires of St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral to the sturdy red walls of the Kremlin, there is much to see and do in this stunning city.

Named after the Moskva River‚Äîwhich flows through the city‚ÄîMoscow has long been at the forefront of the creative world. Tour Moscow to follow in the footsteps of Tolstoy and Chekhov, among others, and join in the sense of pride Russia feels for its literary tradition. Moscow has named a number of its parks and open spaces after its poets and authors, so take a break at the fountain in Pushkin Square, or rest beneath the leafy trees in Gorky Park. When you‚Äôve gotten your fill of literary splendor, head to the Memorial Museum of Cosmonauts, where you can learn about the Soviet Union‚Äôs efforts to reach the stars and the epic space race that lasted from 1955 to 1972.

Moscow is a city of creativity and innovation, but is also very much aware of its own history; as such, a haunting part of any Moscow sightseeing is a visit to the Fallen Monument Park. After the fall of the Soviet Union, countless statues and monuments were removed from their pedestals and moved to this park. Over the years, more modern artwork and sculptures have been added, turning the park into a strange, yet peaceful graveyard of former icons.

What is your favorite part of Moscow?

For the second part of this track, we have formulated another set of frequencies dedicated for a deep, sound sleep and relaxation. Both parts contain the frequency of the Sun, 136.1Hz, which resonates the feelings of calmness, meditative, and centering. It is also connected to the Heart chakra to give you a sense of balance and harmony with the cosmos. As you finish your astral travels, you will find yourself falling into deep sleep and waking up feeling refreshed and energized.

One tip on how to do an astral projection is to repeat this phrase, ""Mind awake, Body asleep."" Let your body fall into slumber. It will feel numb and heavy at the same time. Do not be afraid of strange new sensations. For more tips on astral projection, read our blog:

Vb7NGZQEdTI,Nepal Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Nepal.
At the foot of the huge peaks of the Himalayas is Pokhara and it is from here that we begin our journey through Nepal. In the past, Pokhara was an important trading link between India and Tibet but the trading of salt and wool came to an end after Tibet closed its doors to the outside world.Kathmandu is a melting pot of both race and religion, a metropolis in the heart of the Kingdom of Nepal, a country of snow-covered mountains inhabited by the gods. Kumari Chowk is the residence of the living goddess, Kumari, who is duly selected from childhood. She is not allowed to leave until puberty as her task is it affirm the king his power. Traditional ceremonies are celebrated throughout the year such as the Festival Of The Children that is a symbol of fertility and sexual purity. Patan is Nepal‚Äôs second largest city and has retained much of its original character due to its three hundred monasteries and temples. It is also one of the oldest settlements in Kathmandu Valley and during the 15th century was the capital of one of three kingdoms. Bhaktapur is the third ancient regal city of the thirty kilometre long Kathmandu Valley that has always been a prosperous trading route between China, Tibet and India. Through the golden gate of Sundhoka is the old royal palace complex. The Torana above the gate is richly gilded and features the ten-armed goddess, Taleju, and her loyal guards. Located on a 1,400 metre high hill, Swayanbunath is a Buddhist monastery complex and one of the most interesting sights in Nepal. The country‚Äôs oldest stupa dates back to the 5th century and is entered from an easterly direction up a staircase that contains three hundred and sixty-five steps. Endless rows of prayer mills and religious images are the instruments of the people‚Äôs deep faith. Hidden in a canyon and located on top of a mountain creek, Dakshinkali stands guard over the valley. This wonderful place is dedicated to the bloody goddess, Kali. The customs of the people in the ‚ÄòKingdom On The Roof Of The World‚Äô may seem somewhat strange. But this land of jungle and eternal snow has developed according to its own rich traditions and beliefs. Like magic!

Oo6iAxf4si0,San Francisco Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/San-Francisco.d178305.Destination-Travel-Guides

Leave the regular world behind when you step into the fog-swathed ‚ÄúCity by the Bay.‚Äù From shopping adventures in Union Square to a trip on the city‚Äôs legendary cable cars, a trip to San Francisco is bound to leave you with incredible memories.

Stop by Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf and indulge in its shops and galleries, as well as some of the best fresh seafood you‚Äôll ever taste. Walk on the Golden Gate Bridge and take in the fresh sea air and views of the bay and Pacific Ocean. If it‚Äôs a more serene environment you‚Äôre after, pass through the stately architecture and flowing lagoon of the Palace of Fine Arts. 

Of course, San Francisco sightseeing isn‚Äôt complete without an excursion to Alcatraz, the island prison that once held some of the country‚Äôs most notorious criminals. Look into its empty cells and thick stone walls and wonder, could you escape ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù?

Visit our San Francisco travel guide to plan your Bay Area trip.

Transcript:

Welcome to Lisbon!

Lisbon is Portugal's unassumingly cool capital and western Europe's oldest city that serves over 12 million tourists every year. Way back in 1755 the city was hit by a huge earthquake that destroyed 85% of¬†buildings. The city had no choice but to rebuild itself and the 18th century architecture that reshaped Lisbon is still very dominant today. In fact if you come here, don‚Äôt be surprised to spend most of your time looking up and admiring it as you wander through the fairy tale cobbled streets lined with iconic Portuguese tiles that have inspired artists for generations. Each building and street really does have its own personality.¬†What‚Äôs more, amongst this wealth of history, is an eclectic city renowned for having colourful nightlife, tonnes of culture, music and a cosmopolitan food scene that modestly boasts the best custard tarts on the planet! This city break is ideal all year round, with temperatures rarely going below 10 degrees celsius in the winter and averaging 25 in the summer. It really does seem like Lisbon has it all, and we're here to show you why‚Ä¶

Coming up we‚Äôre going to take you through our top tips for 48 hours in Lisbon. From transport, things to do, places to see, lingo, and where to buy the best custard tarts in the city. We‚Äôve done the research to save you time and help you have the most amazing trip. So let‚Äôs start with how to get here.

The flight from London Gatwick takes just over 2 and a half hours straight into Lisbon‚Äôs only airport which is conveniently just 7km from the heart of the city. 

The best thing about Lisbon Airport is it‚Äôs only a 20 minute drive into the city centre. The easiest way to get in is to jump in a taxi or take the Aerobus. There are two lines running into the main hotel areas that cost ‚Ç¨4 per person each way. 

Alternatively you could take the metro that runs from 6am to 1am everyday or there‚Äôs always the city bus but do expect for both these options to take a little longer. 

Lisbon is known as the city of seven hills so to save your legs from all that climbing you‚Äôll probably gonna want to use public transport at some point. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to get around the city - from train, tram, metro, bus and even funicular lift.

The metro is good choice if you‚Äôre traveling long distances but doesn‚Äôt cover all areas of the city. It‚Äôs one of cleanest metros in Europe, and most stations are open from 6am to 1am every day. 

Trams cover areas of the city where there is no access to the metro. There are two types of trams, the yellow ‚ÄúRemodelado‚Äù trams that route round the old narrow streets and then there‚Äôs modern ‚ÄúArticulado‚Äù trams that operate along the flat sections of the city connecting central Lisbon to the Belem district.

Lisbon has hundreds of buses and 88 different routes so you‚Äôre bound to find one to take you where you need to go. 

The funicular lifts are used to help locals and tourists climb all those hills. The most famous lift is the Santa Justa Lift linking lower and upper Lisbon. Yes, it‚Äôs technically a means of public transport ¬†but it also doubles up a a major tourist attraction and has great a view point at the top. 

We noticed a lot of tourists jumping in Tuk Tuks, and so we thought we‚Äôd give it a go. But it turns out the cobbled streets of Lisbon don‚Äôt make for a comfy ride in a Tuk Tuk, and if I‚Äôm honest a 5 minute ride was a bit of a rip off at ‚Ç¨15.

Working out the best way to pay for transport in Lisbon can get confusing‚Ä¶ so here‚Äôs our simple breakdown‚Ä¶",travel
uJUlOLQShiw,Egypt Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Egypt.
Egypt is a land of monumental temples, gigantic pyramids, the River Nile and the mysterious Sphinx: 5000 years of history.Founded by Alexander The Great in 332 B.C., the city of Alexandria is located in the Nile Delta and it was here that Caesar and Mark Anthony fell under Cleopatra‚Äôs spell. Cairo is Africa‚Äôs largest city and the heart of the Arab world, extreme poverty living next to opulent wealth, and modern, Western boutiques next to ancient souks. The Cairo Museum is home to the most extensive collection of Egyptian antiquities, including the golden mask and tomb of Tutankamun. Towering above almost any other human achievement are the impressive three pyramids of Gisa. The Cheops Pyramid, the world‚Äôs largest single construction, took four hundred thousand workers twenty years to build. It weighs as much as all the cathedrals in Europe put together and spans an area of 53,000 square metres - the height of a fifty storey skyscraper. In the middle of today‚Äôs modern city of Luxor, known as the ‚ÄòCapital City Of The Pharaohs‚Äô, the Luxor Temple stretches along the eastern banks of the Nile and, not far away, the temple complex of Karnak and the Amun Temple. 67 kilometres from Luxor, on the western bank of the Nile, lies the Temple Of Dendera, the most important place of worship for the love goddess, HATHOR, whose heavenly appearance was portrayed by the body of a cow. At Aswan, the landscape of the Nile is enchanting, but it is the stone temples of Abu Simbel that take one back to ancient Egypt, land of the Pharaohs, and archaeological paradise.

LlZ_xDx2Zl0,How To Travel Around London and Buy an Oyster Card - Important Tips!,"Here are some very important tips on how to travel around London and buy an oyster card. 
Especially if  it is your first time visiting London, if you aren't careful you can end up paying a lot more for your travel so it's important you pay the right fare. You can use your oyster card or contactless payment card for lots of different types of transport on London TFL services. This includes buses, trains, tubes, Thames Clipper boats, trams and even the Emirates Airline cable cars. 
My favourite thing to do is to travel on the old Number 15 routemaster buses. A real icon of London. I'll show you all the tips and tricks on how to behave like a true Londoner and not to be barged out of the way by the locals when travelling on transport in London. 
There are other ways to pay for London Transport including Apple Pay on your iphone or with a contactless credit or debit card. But I think it's easiest to get an oyster card when you first arrive. Try to avoid buying paper tickets because they cost more!! And the buses don't accept money so you must have an oyster or credit card or apple pay.

ndxssbwwGZU,SCARIEST Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On,"Roads and bridges are things that are used to travel more efficiently from place to place. They certainly help when it comes to crossing water or great heights between mountains, although those same traits also make these passages absolutely terrifying. These are the Scariest Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend going to any of them. Just trust us.

#8 - Zhangjiajie Glass Walk Bridge
Just a year ago, China opened a breathtaking glass skywalk that had been added to Hunan‚Äôs mountainous landscapes. The winding bridge is 1,410 feet long and, as you can see from these frightening photos, it hovers 984 feet above the ground. This would be the very last place in the world you would find us. You‚Äôre on your own if you want to go check this scary bridge out. 

#7 - Lake Pontchartrain Causeway
You might be able to guess why the bridge in this picture made it into this video just by looking at it. It‚Äôs not particularly high, and it actually only sits 16 feet above the water. The bridge connects the two Louisiana towns of Metairie and Mandeville. It stretches an incredible 24 miles across the lake. If that wasn‚Äôt scary enough, once you get about eight miles into the bridge, you no longer have a visual of land. 

#6 - Captain William Moore Bridge 
Although the bridge in this photo isn‚Äôt all that scary to look at, once you find out about the surroundings and the structural integrity of this bridge, you might just change your mind. This bridge is located in Alaska and it crosses over an ACTIVE earthquake fault. The engineers who designed the bridge planned for the potential disaster and only anchored one end of the bridge securely. Now, when the ground trembles and shifts, the bridge won‚Äôt just be torn apart. However, we want to know how it‚Äôs still safe with only one end secured. How does that work?


#5 - Millau Viaduct, France
The bridge in this picture gives us the same thrilling fear as riding a roller coaster. The bridge pictured here is the Millau Viaduct located in France. The tallest part of the bridge, from the valley floor to tip of the mast is 1,125 feet tall, which is taller than the Eiffel Tower! It may be less than two miles in length, but this is another path we just aren‚Äôt going to bother taking. 

#4 - The Confederation Bridge 
This bridge located in Canada made it into this video not because it is incredibly tall and you‚Äôre scared of heights, but because it is a long eight miles to the other side. You can see just how long it is in this picture. While that in itself doesn‚Äôt seem to shiver worthy, the fact that it is the longest bridge crossing over ice cold water in the world, does. Yes, there are ones that are miles longer, but supposedly not over such freezing waters. This one billion dollar bridge probably won‚Äôt just dump you in the water as it crumbles, but that fear factor that it will is still alive and well. 


#3 - Hussaini Hanging Bridge
Hanging bridge is right! Though it should really be called ‚Äúhanging by a thread bridge,‚Äù just look at the mess in this picture, someone come collect their granny, she needs help! This rickety cable and wood bridge is located in Pakistan, and you couldn‚Äôt pay us enough to cross it. The bridge crosses over the rapidly flowing Hunza River and the tattered and worn remains of the previous bridges hang right next to the one being currently used. To make this bridge that much more unbearable, it was swallowed up by flood waters in 2010. Although there has been a newer one built, it doesn't seem any safer. 


#2 - Monkey Bridges
If you told us that we would have to walk across the scary skinny bridge pictured here, we would have laughed into next week. There‚Äôs just no way. Even though this bridge seems like a joke in a movie, these ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù bridges are used as a quick passage in several parts of Vietnam. The name ‚ÄúMonkey‚Äù bridge comes from the stooped posture you have to adopt when crossing. Just so you know how crazy this bridge is, it is exactly as it looks in the picture; the bridge is made from a single bamboo log with one or two handrails. If you think crossing this is a good idea, best of luck to you and we‚Äôll see you down at the bottom of the river, since you‚Äôre certainly falling in. 


#1 - Eshima Ohashi Bridge
This terrifying bridge wasn‚Äôt a nightmare constructed by an architect but if you looked at this picture of the bridge, you would think it was. This mile long bridge spans across Lake Nakaumi and links the city of Matsue to the city of Sakaiminato. The reason for the sudden climb in the bridge is meant to allow entire barges or ships underneath without incident. Although this bridge looks absolutely terrifying at about a 45-degree angle, it is actually not that steep, and a side view of the bridge shows that the highest point is reached with a gradual incline. It‚Äôs not at all how it appears.",travel
Ca2i3JDmRAM,Avengers Endgame Is NOT A Time Travel Movie,"Avengers 4 Endgame is believed to be a time travel movie. What if I told you that isn't the case at all? Many suspected this after seeing set photos leak. However, after doing some research, I want to propose the theory that Avengers 4 Endgame is NOT actually about time travel in the normal sense as we believe. Instead, there have been some interesting connections that the Russo Brothers have been building up between tony stark and Thanos ever since Captain America Civil War. Check out this unique theory to find out what Avengers Endgame may actually be about and the ""REAL"" solution to defeating thanos.

Our visit Krakow travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide, top sightseeing tourist attractions and the city by day including visiting castles, churches and museums and Krakow by night. We also cover off-the-beaten-path outdoor activities you won't find in a typical Krakow tourism brochure, Krakow itinerary or Krakow, Poland city tour.

Krakow alternate spellings: Krak√≥w, Cracow, Krakau, ÂÖãÊãâÁßëÂ§´

20 Things to do in Krak√≥w, Poland Travel Guide video transcript:

We kicked off this trip to Poland with a visit to Krakow, a city people have been telling us to visit for years and now we know why. Krakow in the summertime was wonderful! We spent our time enjoying castle views from the river side, exploring neighbourhoods covered in street art, eating some of the best pierogie of our lives, and also discovering what we think may be the best ice cream. The following is our travel guide to some of the best things to do in Krakow!

Wawel Castle is Krakow's crowning jewel, and for centuries it was the residence of the kings of Poland. You can see a mix of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque architecture all in one place. 

While in the city, we also had to walk the Royal Route, which was once the historic coronation path of Polish kings.

After visiting the basilica, we spent a bit of time walking the Main Square, which just so happens to be Europe's largest medieval town square.

And that‚Äôs it for our visit to Krakow! We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city. If you have any other places to add to this list or any tips for fellow travellers visiting Krakow feel free to share those.

This is part of our Travel in Poland video series showcasing Polish food, Polish culture, Polish cuisine while visiting Krak√≥w Polska.

zhtg9XgVwuM,Edinburgh Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The Scottish capital of Edinburgh is one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Its Old Town and Royal Mile are filled with the ghosts of medieval merchants, body snatchers, and poets, while its Georgian-styled New Town shines with the glories of the Scottish Enlightenment.  

To see Edinburgh in all her glory, climb to Arthur‚Äôs Seat, the highest of the city‚Äôs seven peaks. Some historians believe this was the site of King Arthur‚Äôs legendary castle Camelot.
 
Nearby, on another volcanic crag, rises Edinburgh Castle, the very symbol of Scotland itself. Over the last eleven centuries, this castle has been laid siege to 26 times but still it stands, a testimony to the indomitable spirit of the Scots.
 
Edinburgh has long held a special place in the hearts of the monarchy. Her Majesty‚Äôs Yacht Britannia sailed over one million miles before being permanently moored at Ocean Terminal as a symbol of the Royal Family‚Äôs affection for the people of Edinburgh.  
 
Edinburgh has been the jewel in the crown of royals for centuries and its old-world chivalry continues today. Thistle Chapel, in St Giles‚Äô Cathedral, honors the Knights and Ladies of Scotland‚Äôs oldest order.
 
In Princes Street Gardens, rises the world‚Äôs largest monument to a writer, dedicated to Sir Walter Scott. At the Writers Museum, learn about more of Scotland‚Äôs cherished literary adventurers. Edinburgh casts her spell over contemporary writers too, JK Rowling wrote two of her Harry Potter series in cozy Old Town nooks, such as the Elephant House Caf√©.
 
For centuries, the University of Edinburgh has given us intellectual giants such as Charles Darwin, David Hume and Alexander Bell. Explore centuries of innovation at the Scottish Museum, or head to South Queensferry to see the Forth Bridge, an engineering marvel when it opened in 1890.

The Royal Botanic Gardens is one of the world‚Äôs oldest and most important centers of botanical science, yet it‚Äôs still a place which invites one to slow down.
 
Edinburgh is a city that has given the world countless gifts, but perhaps her greatest is showing that all parts of the human experience - the sciences and the arts, the past and the present, the sacred and the light-hearted - all have equal value.

Welcome to Seattle, a city that straddles the modern world and the natural one.

While it‚Äôs known for its overcast weather, when the sun comes out in Seattle, you‚Äôre in for the perfect photo op, where blue skies and calm seas surround classic architecture and striking modern buildings. Take in a view of the city from the Observation Deck of Smith Tower, then head down to the waterfront for incredible seafood and harbor cruises.

From there, explore the great outdoors at Woodland Park Zoo, full of recreated savannahs and tropical rainforests.

s2CyfAdTNMs,9 Travel Outfit Ideas (Wear This Not That),"Today I will share 9 travel outfit ideas for the airplane.  I am going to show you a piece of clothing and say, ""Wear this not that."" I will help you know what to wear and what not to wear when you travel.  How you dress in an airplane will help you be more comfortable in your outfit.  You will worry less about stains, you will be at ease when you are sitting and bending over, and you will not be self conscious about what you are wearing. Since we are an airline family, I have come up with 9 travel outfit pieces that will help you know to wear this and not that on the airplane.
The number 1 travel outfit idea is to wear one with a Cardigan Not a Poncho - Cardigans add dimension to your travel outfit, they add layering if you get cold, they add length to your body, cardigans can mix and match with your travel outfits while on vacation, cardigans with pockets give you added function in an airport, like a place to store your phone when you have to pay for a coffee. Cardigans can be light weight or heavy for warmth.  Let me know if you agree with all nine #traveloutfit ideas.

o_TKIM1vUEs,Manchester Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Manchester is a city of firsts. It was the epicenter of the Industrial Revolution, the place where mankind first split the atom, and the birthplace of the modern computer.
 
The many chapters of Manchester‚Äôs story come together in Castlefield. Here you‚Äôll find the remains of a Roman fort, Bridgewater Canal, and some of the mills which once generated incredible wealth for the city. In the background, Beetham Tower is a symbol of a city again on the rise.
 
Manchester‚Äôs crowning glory is its Town Hall, built to rival the great buildings of London. During the Industrial Revolution, Manchester‚Äôs merchants went on a spending spree, scouring the world in search of cultural treasures to fill their stately homes. Many of these treasures now reside in the Manchester Art Gallery and the Manchester Museum.
 
In 1653, the Chetham Library became the country‚Äôs first free public library and has been open to all ever since. Two hundred and fifty years later, one of the city‚Äôs greatest philanthropists, Enriqueta Rylands, unveiled the John Rylands Library, dedicated to the memory of her textile magnate husband.
 
Housed in a restored Edwardian pump house is The People‚Äôs History Museum, which celebrates those who challenged Britain‚Äôs rigid political and class systems. At the world‚Äôs oldest surviving railway station, you‚Äôll find The Museum of Science and Industry, while the Imperial War Museum North reminds us of the human cost of warfare.
 
Explore the city‚Äôs musical heritage in the Northern Quarter, and check out Canal Street, which perfectly encapsulates the Mancunian ideals of tolerance and good times. Learn more about the city‚Äôs footballing history at the National Football Museum, or time your visit for a match at Old Trafford.

Our visit Lisbon travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts, entertainment, museums, nightlife and restaurants. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Lisbon city guide.

20 things to do in Lisbon, Portugal | Top Attractions Travel Guide:

Our first stop of the day was Sao Jorge Castle, which is an old Moorish fortification that sits on a hill overlooking Lisbon and the Tagus River. You can get some nice panoramic views of the city from here, and they also have peacocks roaming the grounds.

Miradouro das Portas do Sol is one of the many look out points in Lisbon that offers postcard-perfect views of the city. This particular terrace overlooks the Alfama district and it is always popular with tourists.

Carmo is a mediaeval convent that was ruined during the 1755 earthquake, and today it is used as an archaeological museum.  It's a strange feeling walking down the ruined nave of the church and seeing blue skies above your head, but that's exactly what makes it worth a visit. 

Another place to visit is Belem Tower. The tower was built on the banks of the Tagus River, and it was meant to act as both a defense system and a ceremonial gateway into Lisbon.

The Jeronimos Monastery is one of the most visited sights in Lisbon. It's one of the best examples of Late Gothic Manueline architecture, so have a close look at the intricate detailing when you visit. 

A fun way to get around Lisbon's hilly streets is by riding the trams. There are different lines across the city, but #28 is the most popular one with visitors.

The Santa Justa lift is an elevator that connects the lower streets of Baixa with Carmo Square, and it is the only remaining vertical elevator in Lisbon. Though it is meant to serve a functional role, it is also quite popular with visitors who find the elevator a novel idea. 

And that's a wrap for our week in the Portuguese capital! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you some ideas of things to do in Lisbon. As always, if you have any other suggestion for travellers of places to visit and things to do around town, feel free to share them in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels!

This is part of our Travel in Portugal series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Portuguese culture, Portuguese arts, Portuguese foods, Portuguese religion, Portuguese cuisine and Portuguese people.

xycecbwpIzE,Travelling With a Physical Disability in Japan,"Part 2: Living in Japan with a Physical Disability https://youtu.be/xycecbwpIzE

Many people are aware that Japan has excellent public transportation. If you're a keen observer, you may have noticed the many wheelchair accessible facilities, but perhaps have not seen physically disabled people make use of them. In this video, Yuriko Oda (Wheelchair Walker) and Josh Grisdale (Accessible Japan) show what it's like to travel with a physical disability in Japan's trains, buses, cars, taxis, and planes. 

This is part of new series of social documentaries about Japan that I'm making. Future episodes will attempt to answer questions like: what are the living conditions of the homeless, what does social housing look life and how affordable is housing, what is it like to work in Japan and is there any work/life balance, and what is it like to go to primary school?

If you'd like to support these types of social documentaries, I now have a Patreon account https://www.patreon.com/lifewhereimfrom. Any support at all will be greatly appreciated!

Both Yuriko and Josh post great information about accessibility in Japan, and you can find them at:

Time travel is a staple of science fiction stories, but is it actually possible?  It turns out nature does allow a way of bending time, an exciting possibility suggested by Albert Einstein when he discovered special relativity over one hundred years ago. Colin Stuart imagines where (or, when) this fascinating phenomenon, time dilation, may one day take us.

Can you take the right amount of nodules to get back to the present before the portal closes? Dan Finkel shows how.

Hello I‚Äôm Abi, and we‚Äôre currently at Gatwick airport - and that can only mean one thing for the Travel Guides team! Err we‚Äôre off to start our epic Italy Adventure, arm and the first stop is Venice!

F2sepCUnENg,Buenos Aires Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Buenos-Aires.d178242.Destination-Travel-Guides

Named for good sailing winds, Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina, and home to nearly a quarter of the country‚Äôs two million residents. Come for the stunning European architecture, and stay for delicious cuts of meat, the city‚Äôs zest for soccer, and, of course, the tango. 

‚ÄúThe Paris of South America‚Äù boasts outstanding shopping and a friendly populace. A tour of Buenos Aires should cut through La Boca Harbor, where you‚Äôll find numerous street vendors, restaurants, and street dancers willing to give you a spin. Wander down the streets to take in colorful artwork, and make a game out of asking the locals what neighborhood you should tour next. Here‚Äôs a hint: with so much to see, everyone will give you a different answer!

Some will tell you to visit San Telmo for souvenirs, patio shopping, and crumbling historical buildings. Others will suggest Puerto Madero, a refurbished shipping port that boasts a mixture of old-world glamour and modern buildings. What everyone will suggest, however, is a stop by Plaza de Mayo. There you can take in the rosy architecture of the Casa Rosada, which was made famous by Argentine First Lady Eva Peron and the musical about her life, ‚ÄúEvita.‚Äù Take a tour and learn about her life, from her humble beginnings to her rise to power.

Cap off your Buenos Aires sightseeing with an evening walk through Puerto Madero, where you can get a late dinner and dance until the next day arrives.

What do you want to see in Buenos Aires?

Here are some things you should know about Responsible Travel: 

We want our customers to have a truly memorable holiday, and we want local communities and wildlife to benefit too. However, our mission has always been bigger than that. We want to make tourism a more caring industry, one that improves places rather than ruins them. We do this in three ways: 

- Try to lead by example with the best practices in responsible tourism.
- Prove the win: win (better holiday for you, better for local places and people) of responsible tourism.
- Target bad practice in our industry with activism and campaigns.

You‚Äôll find honest, genuine holiday reviews on our site from travellers who‚Äôve experienced the trips we offer. As we‚Äôre independent of the specialist holiday companies who run the trips, we rely on our customers‚Äô uncensored feedback to tell us if the trip lived up to its description. Over 90% of our 100,000 customers have rated their holiday 4 or 5 out of 5. https://www.responsibletravel.com/copy/read-real-holiday-reviews-from-real-travellers

We're an activist travel company and we try to raise awareness of controversial and important issues‚Äì we are not afraid to campaign and question the tourism industry in a bid to create change for the better. https://www.responsibletravel.com/copy/activism

Morocco is a North African country that has a coastline on both the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It has borders with Western Sahara to the south, Algeria to the east and the Spanish North African territories of Ceuta and Melilla on the Mediterranean coast in the north. It is just across the Strait of Gibraltar from Gibraltar. 

See in Morocco
==================
At just a few hours from the main European cities, Morocco has everything to overwhelm you with the amazing colors, smells and sounds of Islamic Africa. Imagine bustling souqs and spice markets, stunning mosques, white-washed sea side towns and medieval city centres. With panoramic views varying from snow-covered peaks in the High Atlas to the endless sand dunes of the Sahara, no-one ever has to be bored in this beautiful country.

Movie-famous Casablanca might be the most famous of Moroccan cities and is home to the huge Hassan II mosque, the second largest mosque in the world with only the Grand Mosque of Mecca surpassing it. Many travellers quickly leave this vibrant and modernist metropolis on a search for a more traditional Moroccan experience, but admiring the impressive colonial architecture, Hispano-Moorish and art-deco outlook of the city centre is actually time well spent. Marrakesh, known as the ""Red City"" and probably the most prominent former imperial capital, will leave you with memories to cherish for life. Spend your days wandering through the lively souqs, admiring the old gates and defensive walls, see the Saadian Tombs, the remnants of the El Badi Palace and visit the Koutoubia Mosque with its 12th century minaret. However, when evening falls make sure to head back to Jamaa el-Fnaa, the largest square in Africa, as it fills up with steam-producing food stalls. Indulge in the bustling activity there, listen to Arabic story tellers, watch magicians and Chleuh dancers. Fez, once Morocco's capital, is another gorgeous imperial city. Get lost in its lovely labyrinth of narrow Medieval streets, enjoy its huge medina, see the beautiful city gates, the ancient University of Al-Karaouine and the Bou Inania Madrasa. Also, make sure to visit a traditional leather tanning factory. The city of Meknes is often called the ""Versailles of Morocco"" for its beauty. Its lovely Spanish-Moorish style centre is surrounded by tall city walls with impressive gates and you'll be able to see the 17th century blend of European and Islamic cultures even today.

For a more laid-back experience of city life, catch a sea breeze at Asilah or lovely Essaouira. The blue-washed town of Chefchaouen is an old time travellers' favourite and a great starting point to explore the impressive High Atlas Mountains. Climb Jebel Toubkal, the highest peak in North-Africa, passing lovely adobe villages and exploring the gorgeous Ourika and Amizmiz valleys on the way. The stunning panoramic view from the top will make it worth every bit of your effort to get there. Other praised hiking routes lead through the beautiful Ameln Valley in the Anti-Atlas and the wooded Rif Mountains in the very north.

Hop on a camel back for a trip through the golden Sahara sand dunes at Erg Chebbi, near Merzouga. Spend the night in a desert tent, under the incredibly starred sky. The Sahara is also accessible near the town of Zagora; it's easier to get to from Marrakech but doesn't have the imposing dunes of Erg Chebbi. Somewhat less easy to reach but therefor also less crowded are the dunes of Erg Chigaga near M'hamid. On your way to the desert, make sure not to miss the stunning Todra gorge near Tinghir. The ancient fortified city of A√Øt-Benhaddou is another must-see sight. Although rainstorms damage the mud-brick kasbahs time and again, this mostly abandoned village remains an impressive sight and has been the decor for a range of movies, including Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator.

Do in Morocco
================
Hammams
========
There are two types of Hammam (steam baths) across Morocco. 

The first is the tourist hammam, where you can go and be pampered and scrubbed by an experienced staff member. As these are promoted only to tourists they are the more expensive option with pricing usually around DH 150 for a hammam. They can not be technically referred to as a proper hammam, but they are nonetheless enjoyable, especially for the timid. Your hotel can recommend a good one.

The second option is to visit a ""popular"" Hammam. Popular hammams are the places where the locals go. Ask the staff at your hotel where they would go.",travel

In this week's video we drive through the great state of Indiana.
In the morning, we leave our campsite at the Louisville Metro KOA and begin driving north. The idea is to reach Elkhart, the RV Capital of the World by sundown.

As part of our journey we go through the Indiana capital, the great city of Indianapolis. Although we don't get to explore much, we do drive through downtown, see the Capitol building, which in Indiana is called the Statehouse, and the also famous Soldiers and Sailors Monument which is an obelisk in a very centric traffic circle, which honors the veterans of the Civil War. As we leave the city we also see the Scottish  Right Cathedral, one of the largest masonic buildings in the world. Did I mention it belongs to the Freemasons?

As we continue north we also drive through Kokomo. Remember the Beach Boy's song? ""In the Florida Keys there's a place called Kokomo"". Well it turns out the real Kokomo is here in Central Indiana, and it doesn't display any of the tropical innuendo depicted in the 1980's hit song. There are a bunch of automotive plants, which is surprising because I was under the impression we didn't manufacture anything anymore.

We continue and eventually reach Elkhart. The reason we are here, besides it being a pretty town, is because on the next day we pan to visit the RV/MH Hall of Fame. It is an RV museum, and in their collection the have some of the first houses on wheels, going back to the beginnings of the automobile invention.

uln5qqJTqm0,"Netherlands Summary Travel Video ‚Äì Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, Delft, Rotterdam, Haarlem, Holland","Taking you on a grand journey through the Netherlands, starting with a visit to Haarlem, travelling then down to Leiden, spending three nights in Leiden, doing a few day trips out from there. Then I‚Äôll take you to Delft for three more nights and excursions out from Delft such as to The Hague  which is the political capital of the nation.
http://tourvideos.com/
And then on to Rotterdam the great modern city of the Netherlands, continuing to Utrecht, a university town with a very large historic center and then down to Maastricht in the southern part of the country.  I'll also be going up to the Alkmaar cheese market which is a lot of fun. It happens once a week and it‚Äôs a big touristic event. They re-create what it was like in the old days with the cheese market and the guys running around carrying her sleds full of giant Gouda cheeses, but here in the Netherlands they don't say Gouda, it's 'Howda.' I'll take you to that town of Gouda as well and show you where they make the cheese. 
And then up to Amsterdam for the grand finale.
I‚Äôm staying two nights or three nights in place, in Amsterdam six nights, so I‚Äôll be providing quite thorough coverage showing you the shopping streets and the museums, the old historic neighborhoods, the old brick buildings and going on some canal boat rides as well ‚Äì  that‚Äôs one of the real fun things to do when you‚Äôre in the Netherlands.
In each of the towns I‚Äôll be walking because these towns are compact and historic and have so many things to see while walking around.  And occasionally you can hop on a tram or hop on a bus and that helps you get along. Maybe you want to rent a bicycle. Everybody here is on bicycles.
The Netherlands is a land of canals and bicycles and beautifully and preserved old towns such as Delft and Leiden seem like the architecture hasn‚Äôt changed in the last 300 years.
And it‚Äôs really quite a revelation to see how modern everything is at the same time 
The people of course are highly educated. They have some of the top universities in the world in the Netherlands, and the higher education is all but free for those who are interested.
And it‚Äôs just a nation of friendly people, smart people, very productive people as well. Fortunately for us, just about all of them speak very good English, so it‚Äôs very easy to get by when you are visiting here.
I‚Äôll be spending three weeks traveling by train, and the Netherlands has got perhaps the best  train system in Europe. Yes maybe even better Switzerland. It‚Äôs phenomenal. The trains are clean, fast, frequent.
The foods are great. You can have a reasonable lunch for about ‚Ç¨12, say the equivalent of no more than $15 ‚Äì often it‚Äôs a good hearty sandwich and a cappuccino or a beer. Of course the Dutch love their beer.
And they also drink a lot of wine as well. They don‚Äôt produce wine, but being in Europe, in the center of Europe, it is very easy for them to bring in wines from not just France and Italy and Spain but all over the world actually. You see always a good variety on menus, but especially it's the beer. 
They must have dozens of varieties of beer that are brewed right here in the Netherlands.
Now people also call this country Holland and that‚Äôs a common mistake actually because Holland is just part of the Netherlands. It's two provinces on the Western side but the country actually the Netherlands. And  the people are Dutch,  they speak Dutch. It‚Äôs a unique language. It‚Äôs a separate language but has similarities to German and to Danish.
I‚Äôm traveling in the in the month of September which is a good time to be here, and I got real lucky with the weather so far, it has been perfect. It‚Äôs been let‚Äôs say 75¬∞F 20¬∞ 22¬∞C, just very comfortable and actually a bit warmer that should be at this time of year and that‚Äôs a good thing, sometimes you get lucky.
So it‚Äôs a real excursion through the Netherlands, not just visiting Amsterdam.
Even if you are only going to Amsterdam you should spend 4 to 5 days there so you can do some day trips because the country is pretty small and you can travel all way to the Hague for example by train in about 45 minutes from Amsterdam, so it could be a home base for you.
Traveling for three weeks in this wonderful country was a great experience, including all the way down to Maastricht at the southern tip of the Netherlands, and a little side trip over to Aachen in Germany to see the Cathedral dating back to the year 800. 
You're going to love this upcoming series of movies about the Netherlands. 
We will focus on Amsterdam, of course. I spent a week in this wonderful city. We will have pictures of the museums, the restaurants, the canals, the streets, the old buildings, Rembrandt's house ‚Äì and yes it took a lot of walking to get these shots. It was three weeks on foot.
The Netherlands presents the visitor with the wonderful variety of sights to see. You're going to love this upcoming series of movies about the Netherlands.",travel

TfYCnOvNnFU,Traveling Waves: Crash Course Physics #17,"Get Your Crash Course Physics Mug here: https://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-physics-mug

Waves are cool. The more we learn about waves, the more we learn about a lot of things in physics. Everything from earthquakes to music! Ropes can tell us a lot about how traveling waves work so, in this episode of Crash Course Physics, Shini uses ropes (and animated ropes) to talk about how waves carry energy and how different kinds of waves transmit energy differently.

Xfp-W1HDW2M,TRAVEL ON A BUDGET | How we travel so often?! | TOP Travel Tips,"Some of the most beautiful sights don't cost a dime to see and even when they do I've figured out how to save my family hundreds $$ of dollars. This video features my top 13 tips and tricks to saving money and getting more time on your trip for the same price! Have travel hacks of your own? Comment them below and tell me your dream destination!


ADDITIONAL TIPS:

‚òÜ Request early check-in and late check-out at your hotel
‚òÜ Leave the liquids at home! Hotels will ALWAYS give you extra shampoo, soap etc. if you ask
‚òÜ Most car insurances will cover your rental car for FREE - check your policy to avoid paying for unnecessary coverage
‚òÜ Don't forget many car rental agencies add a fee per day for drivers under age 25 - but it varies from company to company so do your research
‚òÜ Forgot your phone charger? Don't buy a new one, ask the front desk to borrow one of their MANY extras

MILITARY SPECIFIC TIPS: (Thank you for your service!)

‚òÜ Always select ""Government Rate"" when booking hotels (EVERY hotel we have ever stayed at has offered one)
‚òÜ Checked baggage is almost always FREE with your military ID (we save a lot this way and still get to pack extras)
‚òÜ Ask for military discounts everywhere you go- you'd be surprised how many places give you 10% or more off purchases
‚òÜ Disney World offers military pricing as well as a military only resort for both veterans and their families called Shades of Green (which does not appear on the Disney Booking website)

ieWNzZPfZzk,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro.d178301.Destination-Travel-Guides

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city‚Äôs iconic peak, and try not to look down ‚Äì it‚Äôs a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

The ‚ÄúCidade Maravilhosa,‚Äù or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

Many of you ask me if it's okay to travel to Japan even though you speak no Japanese and the simple answer is YES! With basic English and gestures you can get around Japan, however for those of you still worried about the language barrier than try out ili when you're travelling next time :)

uAUfF8UVAdI,How to Use the Tokyo Subway | JAPAN TRAVEL GUIDE,"In this video, I show you everything you need to know in order to use the Tokyo Metro System effectively. It can be complex and intimidating if it's your first time in Tokyo, so hopefully this video will simplify it for you, from buying tickets to finding your destination. Don't be scared of Tokyo Subway! It's probably one of the world's most efficient transportation systems, and can get you anywhere! This is the first video of my Japan Guide series, so stay tuned for more tips and tricks for traveling/moving to Tokyo, Japan!

I have people asking how to calculate their fare for a specific trip, you can use Google Maps which tells you the single ticket fare, so you will pay 5-10Yen less if you are using an IC card. You can also use Tokyo Metro's calculator which tells you all different fares but only available for Tokyo Metro lines (so excluding TOEI/JR lines): http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/search/index.php

EXTRA INFO YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:
Links to download apps (don't worry, not sponsored!)
Google Maps (you can also use the web version): goo.gl/BsX25s
Tokyo Subway: goo.gl/vyqi3M

Day Pass Prices (prices as of the day this video was upload
Tokyo-Metro-Only 24h Pass - 600 Yen
Tokyo Metro & Toei 1-day Pass - 1000 Yen
Everything 1-day Pass - 1590 Yen
TOURIST-ONLY Tokyo Metro & Toei Passes - 800 Yen for 24h, 1200 Yen for 48h & 1500 Yen for 72h (available for purchase at Haneda & Narita Airports, select BIC CAMERA stores, travel agencies, etc. More about this pass: https://goo.gl/HWJLps)

TIPS FOR SAVING $$$
1. Stick to Tokyo Metro lines only - these 9 lines should get you to all touristic destinations (some may require slightly longer transit time, but it won't be much longer than the more expensive route)
2. Avoid buses if you are just traveling - they are expensive and doesn't provide free transfer to metro
3. Buy a combo pass if you arrive from Narita or Haneda Airport, they can save you a lot of money. More info: https://goo.gl/YxiVpo
4. Group together sights that can only be accessed by subway within the time period limited by the 24h/48h/72h metro pass. Go to sights that are accessible by foot on other days

Lyrics:

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

I'm traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who
Forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light' like we used to do

But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to do
I'm traveling light

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

F2sepCUnENg,Buenos Aires Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Buenos-Aires.d178242.Destination-Travel-Guides

Named for good sailing winds, Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina, and home to nearly a quarter of the country‚Äôs two million residents. Come for the stunning European architecture, and stay for delicious cuts of meat, the city‚Äôs zest for soccer, and, of course, the tango. 

‚ÄúThe Paris of South America‚Äù boasts outstanding shopping and a friendly populace. A tour of Buenos Aires should cut through La Boca Harbor, where you‚Äôll find numerous street vendors, restaurants, and street dancers willing to give you a spin. Wander down the streets to take in colorful artwork, and make a game out of asking the locals what neighborhood you should tour next. Here‚Äôs a hint: with so much to see, everyone will give you a different answer!

Some will tell you to visit San Telmo for souvenirs, patio shopping, and crumbling historical buildings. Others will suggest Puerto Madero, a refurbished shipping port that boasts a mixture of old-world glamour and modern buildings. What everyone will suggest, however, is a stop by Plaza de Mayo. There you can take in the rosy architecture of the Casa Rosada, which was made famous by Argentine First Lady Eva Peron and the musical about her life, ‚ÄúEvita.‚Äù Take a tour and learn about her life, from her humble beginnings to her rise to power.

Cap off your Buenos Aires sightseeing with an evening walk through Puerto Madero, where you can get a late dinner and dance until the next day arrives.

What do you want to see in Buenos Aires?

5J6mUK2bbaQ,Paris (France) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 3.913 Hotels in Paris - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2SLwWQk

Travel video about destination Paris in France.
Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. First established by the Celts, next used strategically by the Romans, then it served the extravagant lifestyle of the Sun King, Louis XIV until it became a hotbed of Revolution.

Champs-√âlys√©e is surely one of the most beautiful avenues in the world. It has wide boulevards, shady corners, ambient street cafes and classic Parisian buildings that are decorated with flowers.

Since 1873, the Palais de l'√âlys√©e has been the residence of the French President. At the beginning of the 17th century, Madame de Pompadour lived there and during the Revolution the liberated people cavorted in its luxurious rooms.

Through a small triumphal arch decorated with scenes of Napoleon's victorious army, there is the garden created by Leotre, the Jardin des Tuileries. A bridge and fountain are the focal points of this popular park, created in typical French style.

A modern glass pyramid and a fountain decorate the courtyard of the former Louvre Palace, which since the time of the Revolution has been transformed into a museum that contains the famous Louvre art gallery. Its collection of remarkable historic treasures and superb art collection make it one of the world's most famous museums with Leonardo Da Vinci¬¥s masterpiece, the Mona Lisa, taking pride of place.

Situated on a small island on the River Seine is the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the 'Mother Church of the Nation'. Built on the foundations of a Roman temple and commissioned by the bishops Maurice and Eudes de Sully, it took almost 200 years to build this Gothic masterpiece.

Built at the end of the 19th century as a symbol of national revival, Montmartre's Sacre Coeur has the appearance of a white, fairy-tale palace with 237 steps that lead up to the main entrance of this extraordinary structure. Its Byzantine architecture and five cupolas are reminiscent of the Marcus Dome in Venice.

Of course, there are the dizzy heights of the Eiffel Tower and a great deal more. Paris is a wonderful festival of the senses!

Bon Matin! 

It‚Äôs our first morning in lovely Paris, and we‚Äôve just had breakfast. I had an omelette, and it was really really delicious.

We are now on our way to Notre Dame, but lots to see and do, very excited, and I‚Äôll keep you posted throughout the day!

See ya later!!

Hello, me again! Some back stage exclusives, just been interviewing a guy called Tibaut, at the restaurant we ate at last night. Just got some questions around this kinda food, and what makes France and particularly Paris food so amazing. 
Really good, we‚Äôre actually going to break for lunch ourselves now, so stay tuned and I‚Äôll keep you posted a bit later on!

Bye!

So we‚Äôve just done some various shots along the Champs-Elys√©es, and Arc De Triomphe. Now on a bridge on our way to the Louvre, a very lovely bridge actually, that‚Äôs what I like about France everything is so opulent, even their lampposts are really swish! Check this out‚Ä¶ 
And yeah! On our way to the Louvre. 

See ya later!!

Ok, so I‚Äôm now on the bank of the River Seine, just did a quick French tutorial with a couple of guys from Discover Walks. They‚Äôre a company based here in France. They do really really good tour guides, Tom walked me from the Louvre, through the gardens... I can‚Äôt pronounce it! Jardin de Tuileries?!
Basically means, and roughly translated to, tile gardens because there used to be a tile factory there.

Learnt some insider tips about the Louvre: don‚Äôt go to the tourist entrance because that‚Äôs for chumps, apparently! Go like the locals and use one of the many other ones that are lying around!

The weather is glorious! So I'm gunna walk to the Eiffel Tower! See ya soon!",travel

Bangkok, Thailand
The Asian city of Bangkok is situated in central Thailand and is home to over 8 million people.

Judged on criteria like culture, cuisine, shopping and value for money, Bangkok repeatedly wins the highest travel accolades.

Climb aboard a long-tail boat to experience the city from its waterways. Hop off at one of the many temples which line the river, such as Wat Pho, the home of the reclining Buddha.

Thai cuisine is renowned the world over. There are over 50 000 places to eat in Bangkok, with some of the best offerings dished up by street vendors.

While some come to eat, others come to shop. From fabrics to spices, handicrafts to designer brands, Bangkok is heaven for bargain hunters.

Thai nightlife is legendary. For a great night out head to Khao San Road, a major backpackers and entertainment hub.

Just to the city's north lays the ancient capital Ayutthaya, while to the south the resort town of Pattaya lights up nightly.

Bangkok is just a short flight away from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

ieWNzZPfZzk,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro.d178301.Destination-Travel-Guides

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city‚Äôs iconic peak, and try not to look down ‚Äì it‚Äôs a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

The ‚ÄúCidade Maravilhosa,‚Äù or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

KoH2bU9xADg,"The people, history and culture of Uzbekistan - Traveling the Silk Road | DW Documentary","With its magical buildings, fascinating landscapes and friendly people, Uzbekistan has a lot to offer. It is a country caught between rich traditions and modernity.

Wild equestrian games, fairytale palaces and hospitable people proud of their magnificent culture - all this will be encountered by those traveling through Uzbekistan on the Silk Road. The central Asian country borders Kazakhstan to the north and Afghanistan to the south. The journey begins in Samarkand, one of central Asia‚Äôs oldest cities.

For centuries cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva provided the necessary infrastructure for the caravans on the Silk Road, allowing merchants to trade their goods and providing accommodation for them and their animals. Many buildings still survive to underline the splendor and wealth that trade once generated. In Samarkand, one of the world‚Äôs oldest cities, three outstanding Koran schools, known as madrasas, on Registan Square have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Boysun region in the Hissar Mountains the ancient, and none-too-gentle riding game known as Kopkari is held at Nowruz, the New Year festival. More than a hundred horsemen try to pick up the body of a dead goat from the ground and to escape with this from all the others. In 1380 the Uzbek folk hero Amir Timur (Tamerlane) had the gigantic Ak Sarav, the White Palace, built in Shahrisabz, the town of his birth. It had a thousand rooms adorned with gemstones.

I explored my DNA with 23andMe! Learn more about your genetics through 23andMe and get 30% off your order.

Science fiction has introduced us all to the idea of traveling into the past ‚Äì but is it really possible?

Sean Carroll talks bout how time travel would possibly work in the context of Einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity, including the hypothetical idea of wormholes connecting distant regions of space. Dr. Carroll also explores the logical structure of time travel, and what it implies about predestination and free will. In the end, time travel is probably not possible, but by taking the idea seriously we help understand how the universe works.

Dr. Carroll is a Senior Research Associate in Physics at the California Institute of Technology. His most recent book is ‚ÄúFrom Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time‚Äù, a popular book on cosmology and the arrow of time. He is a contributor to the blog Cosmic Variance.

pwymX2LxnQs,Travel Deep Inside a Leaf - Annotated Version | California Academy of Sciences,"Please turn on subtitles with the CC (Closed Captions) button to see the explanatory annotations designed for educators.

Transcript of closed captions:

0:05: We are approaching a redwood tree. To animate a scientifically accurate leaf, artists studied the texture of a redwood leaf specimen on a glass slide at high resolution. They even counted the stomata, and used that exact count for this film!

0:25: These leaves would be measured on a centimeter scale. Throughout the animation, we will gradually zoom in to smaller scales.

0:40: As we approach a single stoma, we are now on a millimeter scale.

0:48: As we enter the interior of the leaf, we see many individual palisade cells.  These cells are where photosynthesis takes place; they are translucent to allow sunlight to enter.  

1:00: As we approach a single palisade cell, we‚Äôll zoom down to the micrometer scale.  The shapes inside the cell are organelles: the bright globules at the bottom are the Golgi apparatus; the yellow spotted tubes are endoplasmic reticulum studded with ribosomes.  

1:09: That large, blue membrane surrounds the nucleus; the purple blobs are mitochondria.

1:18: The faint, yellow, spider-web structure of the cytoskeleton provides structure and support to the cell.

1:24:  You are about to enter a chloroplast; inside you see flat, pancake-like membranous structures called thylakoids.  This is where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place to produce ATP, the cell‚Äôs energy carrier molecule. way


1:38:  The time scale has changed:  the molecules are shown moving 1 million times slower than in real life!

1:42: As we near an individual thylakoid, the animation scale continues to shrink down to the molecular level, where things are measured in nanometers.


1:52: The green and blue bush-like structures are photosystems: clusters of proteins that absorb light energy from the sun and help convert it into the chemical energy that‚Äôs stored in the bonds of the energy carrier molecule called ATP.

2:03: The yellow-green, rotating structure is an enzyme called ATP synthase.  It pumps protons from one side of the thylakoid membrane to the other, assembling ATP molecules in the process.  

2:16: The pulses of light in the thylakoid membrane in which the photosystems are embedded represent energized electrons being passed from one photosystem to another, passing along the energy which will be stored in the bonds of ATP (the classic ‚Äúbucket brigade‚Äù).

2:26: The small ‚Äúwigglies‚Äù are ATP molecules.  Living things store energy in the bonds of the ATP molecules and then use that energy to conduct all the processes of life.  

This animation is a model, and has its strengths and limitations. In order to model something well, visual artists have to make decisions about what to represent and how best to do so. What‚Äôs present in this model, and what‚Äôs intentionally missing or altered? Find out by visiting https://www.calacademy.org/educators/travel-deep-inside-a-leaf

The California Academy of Sciences is a renowned scientific and educational institution dedicated to exploring, explaining, and sustaining life on Earth.

Pear-Shaped Atom Points To A Cosmic Mystery
https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2016/06/27/pear-shaped-atom-points
‚ÄúAn atom is comprised of dense nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a diffuse cloud of electrons. Since an atomic nucleus is held together by the strong force, similar to the way gravity holds stars and planets together, you would think nuclei would be basically spherical. This isn't always the case, and a few such as barium-144 are even pear shaped. ‚Äù

Boston is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Massachusetts, officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. One of the oldest cities in the United States, Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan colonists from England. 
The most important places to visit in Boston are: Boston Common (starting point for Freedom Trail, dating back to 1634, this central public park is loved by locals as well as visitors), Massachusetts State Building (given its gold dome, the state capital can not be missed. It is the seat of the Massachusetts government), Faneuil Hall (constructed in 1742, it has been an important meeting hall. Today there's a market that offers many places to eat and shop), Beacon Hill (a famous historical neighborhood of Boston, amidst its well preserved streets, you will feel like you've gone back in time), Granary (part of the Freedom Trail, it was built in 1660. The site is the resting place for many prominent personalities and statesmen), Trinity Church (said to be one of the greatest buildings in the country, for a special treat, attend a concert during Christmas season), Harvard University (considered to be the world's greatest academic institution, you can tour its campus to soak in the wonderful ambiance), Copley Square (many important buildings with diverse architecture styles are here. This is also the site of the Boston Marathon's finish line) and many more.

t40hlvzEvwY,Can SpaceX Make Point-To-Point Space Travel Profitable?,"SpaceX and Blue Origin think point-to-point space travel will replace flights as the preferred means of passenger travel. A plane ride from New York City to Shanghai is about 15 hours - and it could be as long as 29 hours with connecting flights. With point-to-point travel, SpaceX says it could get you there in less than an hour. How realistic is this approach to long-haul travel?

As companies like Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin close in on offering trips to the edge of space, space tourism is becoming a possibility. But what if spaceships went farther ‚Äî and faster?

Point-to-point space travel has been touted as a business line by SpaceX, Elon Musk‚Äôs rocket and spacecraft company.

AD8vRDaJWPs,NAGALAND - DZUKOU VALLEY &amp; JAKHAMA  | Travelling in North-East India | Indian Travel vlogs,"Welcome To Nagaland! (3/3) DZUKOU VALLEY & JAKHAMA - The villages in Nagaland.

I visited Nagaland in the month of April and had the opportunity to open my mind to endless experiences! For the longest time, Nagaland and the whole of North East has been so neglected: tourism wise and also culturally :(. So I took the plunge to discover the beautiful state myself, with two other creators- Tanya Khanijow & Namrata Menon. These girls have been the most lovely to travel with :)
This is Part 2 of the Nagaland series #TakeMeToNagaland! there are 3 in total! please watch part 1 because it's super fun and features the cities - Dimapur & Kohima ( the capital of Nagaland)


üôèüôèThings to remember when you plan your travel:üôèüôè

üôèThe Visvema route (the one I took) is much easier compared to the Jakhama route. 

üôèYou can camp  the previous night at Campsite Yedika just like I did, before you trek to the valley.

üôèDrones are not allowed in the valley (we had special permissions to use them)

üôèYou can get in touch with @tirelessfoot_nicholas on Instagram, incase you're interested to trek to the valley. He's a good buddy, and will help you in the best way

üôèEntry to the valley is INR 20/- only

üôèCarry your sleeping bags and down jackets cuz it's super windy and extremely cold at night. I went in the month of April and it was super cold.

üôèThe best option would be to trek early in the morning and reach the dormitory by or before 2pm. 

üôèDO NOT trek to Dzukou without a local guide.


üôèYou need an ILP-(Inner Line Permit) to enter the state of Nagaland. You can apply here‚Äî  https://www.india.gov.in/application-... 

üôèCommute in the city is pretty straightforward. You can use the local rickshaws, or hire a car to go around. The roads are super bumpy especially in Dimapur & Kohima, so be prepared :D

üôèThe food scene is very much different than mainland. Vegetarians options are available, but make sure you mention you‚Äôre vegetarian since they also tend to cook their veggies in pork fat. Nagaland thrives on pork and beef, and a lot of things you don‚Äôt see in the rest of the country. I suggest that you visit with an open mind, else it will be super difficult to survive. I personally loved the food. :D

üôèMake sure you have enough cash on you. It‚Äôs advisable to carry cash from home since it was even hard to find ATMs. 

üôèHomestays are the best way to experience the local living. Since the people are super friendly, the hosts are lovely to interact with and know so many things about the Naga culture.

üôèDo a lot of research before you visit. The state has 16 different tribes and they speak different dialects. Read about their lifestyle and food. 

üôèCarry your rainwear and warm clothes since the weather is pretty unpredictable. The best time to travel according to me is December (for Hornbill festival ) and also April. 

üôèNagaland is a dry state! :P 

üôèNagaland is a state full of beauty and the nicest people I've ever come across. The misconceptions about this magic land are hilarious! So do not believe anything else you hear about this place. We stayed here for 10 days and had no issues, problems at all! Trust me! Your next travel, must be planned for the north-east especially NAGALANDDD! 


üíãAlso, thanks to Tanya and Namrata, for helping me film so many shots!

JRaakIL-N_s,Fiji Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Fiji.d6023598.Destination-Travel-Guides

The locals in Fiji have a saying, ‚ÄúBulla,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúgood health.‚Äù You‚Äôll hear it used frequently as a greeting when you arrive at the 330-strong islands that comprise this archipelago. You may even find yourself saying it before long!

Any Fiji tour will highlight its magnificent, unspoiled waters and lush landscapes. Go snorkeling, swimming, diving, and sailing on turquoise waters. If you‚Äôd rather stay on dry land, you can zipline through rainforests or explore the windy plains of the highland area. Travel to the interior and learn about traditional Fijian culture, or visit the capital city of Suva and wander through its colonial buildings, bazaars, and the quiet harbor. 

Two-thirds of the Fijian archipelago are uninhabited, and your Fiji sightseeing should include a stop at Denarau‚Äôs marina, where you can book a boat to take you to some of these pristine locations. From family-friendly islands to romantic getaways, you‚Äôll find something to your taste amongst these scattered isles.

R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,"Many people daydream about traveling the world, but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling ‚Äì hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book ‚Äú1000 Days of Spring‚Äù and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: http://tomislavperko.com/en/.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx",travel

N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/caribbean/cuba.d44

It‚Äôs only 93 miles from Florida, and just 13 from the Bahamas, but like the smoke that coils from its legendary cigars, The Republic of Cuba exists in a time and space all its own.
 
Few cities can stir the imagination like Cuba‚Äôs capital, Havana, a city preserved by forts, a five-mile seawall, and an imposed embargo, which held back the excesses of the 20th century for over 50 years.
  
Havana‚Äôs lure can be hard to resist, but Cuba offers so much more beyond the seductive lights of its capital. In Cuba, a long sandy beach is never far away. 
 
Just 12 miles from Havana‚Äôs downtown, the Eastern Beaches unroll toward the town of Matanzas, the birthplace of the rumba, and C√°rdenas, where the Cuban Flag flew for the very first time. From here, follow the scent of fresh lime, rum and suntan lotion north to Varadero. 
 
After exploring the northern coastline, turn south towards Cuba‚Äôs most revolutionary city, Santa Clara, and Trinidad, once the sugar capital of the world. Don‚Äôt miss elegant Cienfuegos, the only Cuban city founded by the French. 
 
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know whether Cuba is awakening to the world, or if the world is awakening to Cuba. Whatever your politics, it's easy to admire this island nation that has proudly gone its own way.
 
Cuba may still have one foot firmly in the past, but as the world tumbles towards tomorrow, we can be thankful for the many things it has not let go.",travel

vzSHcyXfNPw,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

a3hE02f4Xh4,GATEWAY OF INDIA (&amp; getting dental work done in India) | India Travel,"Today we visited the beautiful Gateway of India! This intricate gateway was built to commemorate King George V and Queen Mary visiting India in 1911.

We also paid a visit to the many dentists of Mumbai! Rob broke one of his teeth on the train to Mumbai so we went looking for a reputable dentist in Mumbai. We‚Äôve heard that getting dental work done in India is actually something foreigners pay to do since it is a lot cheaper than a lot of countries and also of very high quality. So really, we are in the best possible place to fix Rob's teeth!

73ulvWgcZKA,Should My Boyfriend and I Travel Alone? // Ask Pastor John,"Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together and stay in the same hotel? Should they? Pastor John gives three reasons why they shouldn‚Äôt.

Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together? Stay in the same hotel? Should they? It‚Äôs a question we get regularly. And this time from a young woman. ‚ÄúHello, Pastor John. My boyfriend and I plan to leave in three weeks for a trip we scheduled five months ago. My mother said she fears for us and for the temptations that could arise during the trip. I have assured her that while we have fallen into temptation in the past, we have desperately sought God and other Christian counsel to confront that pattern, and that we truly have laid it at the foot of the cross. After discussing this respectfully and in full, we concluded that all would be fine.

‚ÄúToday my mother again confronted me and tells me that she believes we are dishonoring God, even though we will be staying in separate rooms the entire week. While I am frustrated, I also do not want to dishonor my parents‚Äô wishes. I‚Äôm troubled in wondering if we are dishonoring God by traveling together before marriage.‚Äù

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9h

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ

Q How do you work together with brands?

O9_QA69bz9M,INDIA LUXURY TRAVEL: CONRAD BENGALURU | TRAVEL VLOG IV,"India luxury travel to is truly underexplored. In this vlog I‚Äôm exploring the beautiful luxury hotel called Conrad Bengaluru. The Conrad hotel in Bangalore is one of the most beautiful luxury hotels in the city. For me it has been a dream property to review, ever since the Conrad Bengaluru opened it's doors a little over a year ago.

Especially as a foreigner it‚Äôs good to know India is not just a budget destination. You can find anything here as a foreigner tourist. It‚Äôs such a shame not to explore India luxury travel for a holiday.

I hope this video helps foreigner tourists when traveling India and inspires to include a luxury getaway, next to other adventures. More information on Conrad Bengaluru: https://bit.ly/2M02Gij

nPOO1Coe2DI,Dubai Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Dubai-Emirate.d1079.Destination-Travel-Guides

Come to Dubai, the ancient City of Gold, for your next vacation.

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city. Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania¬Æ, a ‚Äúcity‚Äù where children can roleplay various careers.

To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you‚Äôd like to try something a little different and don‚Äôt mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren‚Äôt staying there.

You can‚Äôt finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all. 

Visit our Dubai travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

Avengers: Endgame Timeline

So the movie opens three weeks after Thanos carried out the snap. The universe is devastated but after the surviving Avengers track him down and Thor finally goes for the head we pick up with them five years down the line, in 2023, which is where things start to get a bit confusing.

Due to the discovery of Time Travel, we start off with our heroes all in the same position at the Quantum Tunnel. They have split into groups, all with their own objectives and we initially follow Team A, made up of Captain America, Iron-Man, Ant-Man and Hulk.

This group travels to the Battle of New York to retrieve 3 infinity stones and split off into their own smaller groups. This is set during 2012 and it‚Äôs pretty much the moment that the entire infinity stone saga began with Thanos appearing in the post credits scene of The Avengers to kick everything off. However, things don‚Äôt play out exactly as expected and it‚Äôs at this point that Loki takes the tesseract and travels off to Disney + thus creating an alternate timeline.

Hulk and Ant-Man gain the Time and Mind Stone and together they travel back to 2023, however Tony and Cap still need to secure the tesseract and from here and thus they travel to the 1970s to secure the Tesseract. We will call this group Team AA and Hulk and Ant-man, Team AB. But what happened to the timeline they‚Äôd just left?

Well for now, that‚Äôs royally screwed up for the moment and at this point Thanos would probably still most of the stones, however he wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry out the snap so would probably just go planet to planet murdering people the old fashioned way.

In addition to this the timeline that they‚Äôve just left is slightly altered with the stones missing and though Tony managed to get some stuff off his chest, he‚Äôs still left this timeline very vulnerable.

Team B made up of War Machine, Nebula, Hawkeye and Black Widow then travel to 2014 during the events of Guardians of The Galaxy. This team then splits into Team BA and Team BB with Team BA, made up of War Machine and Nebula securing the power stone from Morag.

Rhodey returns back to the present with the power stone, but Nebula is kidnapped, and replaced with evil Nebula who is carrying out the bidding of Thanos. We will call this team, made up of Thanos‚Äô forces Team BC.

This timeline is really messed up now too. The events of Guardians Of The Galaxy do not happen as Quill is unable to get the Powerstone and the Gamora from this universe travels with Thanos to 2023 to fight the avengers, which I‚Äôll get into later.

On Vormir we join Team BB, Black Widow sacrifices herself in order for Hawkeye to gain the Soul Stone and he travels back to the present.

yORJH5B4z1o,FAMILY of FOUR converts OFF-GRID VAN to travel the WORLD,"Get the Van Conversion Guide: http://bit.ly/GetVanGuide

We met up with Charlotte and Andre and their two children to check out how they made their incredible van conversion! 

Hire this van with Quirky Campers: https://goo.gl/c7TNqm

This van conversion has a few pretty innovative features including TWO double beds, wood burner, fixed sky light and a beautiful rustic design.

This off-grid van conversion has a solar kit to allow for being away from campsites (or to avoid paying to plug in!) and gives them everything they need to travel as a family.

It is so cool to see this adventurous family create a beautiful living space that allows them to chase their dreams of traveling the world together.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Over the past few years I've found myself averaging anywhere from 2-4 flights a month. That's more than the typical American. I am lucky that I get to create my own schedule, and skip off to a new adventure whenever I please- here are the 10 travel mistakes that I've made so that you are aware of them and don't make them. Some of these are rookie travel mistakes that may seem obvious, and some of these are more personal to my perspective on traveling and how to have a fulfilling trip. I hope these help you in your travels!

My Millennial Life Crisis was started 3 years ago when I was stuck in a rut creatively, career wise, and personally. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I wasn't happy with where I was living, and I didn't feel like I had much of a support system. That is how the Millennial Life Crisis series was born. It was a way for me to let go of my feelings and document my personal growth. Along the way I have found that a lot of you have related with this feeling, that is why I keep vlogging. From now on you can expect weekly Millennial Life Crisis episodes about my life, growing up, career growth, trying new things, friendships, relationships, family, and travels.",travel

Qu7NZ1rC1Ow,Liechtenstein (Europe) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Liechtenstein in Europe.
In the middle of the triangular border of Germany, Austria and Switzerland lies a treasure of the European Alps, the Principality of Liechtenstein.  Hardly anywhere else in Central Europe has experienced such a rapid transformation from a dreamy agrarian state into one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Bendern, part of the village of Gamprin, is one of eleven municipalities and lies to the south-west side of the Eschner Mountain.  The view glides across the foothills of the romantic Rhine Valley and up to the massive Swiss Schw√§g-Alp. The Schaedler ceramics workshop in Nendeln is one of the oldest commercial enterprises in Liechtenstein and features handmade works of art.  Since 1836, they have specialised in earthenware, exclusive ceramic art and tilted stoves. Schaan forms the border to the Oberland, a charming municipality with an attractive town centre.  A parish hall and provision of good restaurants reflect the success of the global companies that are located there. Liechtenstein Castle looms majestically above Vaduz, the capital.  Saint Florin is located on the edge of the old town it was built in 1868 in Neo-Gothic style and in 1997 officially dedicated as a cathedral.  From the Sareiser Joch there are several trails along the ridge such as the Princess Gina Route that traverses various mountains of the border triangle.  More than four hundred well marked hiking trails are offered throughout Liechtenstein, plus a hundred and sixty kilometres in the Alps. The Principality is a treasure trove of both landscape and culture with mountains, pastures, castles, fortresses and museums.  But Liechtenstein has also become a small, modern state with a vital and indelible focus on finance and industry, a tiny paradise that is also an important economic power.

iXGtx-hroKE,Working online and traveling the world - digital nomads | DW Documentary,"Working online whilst traveling the world sounds like a dream job for many people. But what exactly is a digital nomad? Pete and Supi live as digital nomads.

They travel the world permanently, work on the road and are always online. Their lives epitomize the digital revolution and how it is changing how we work live.

Many people dream of living and working on the road - a dream that has come true for Pete and Supi. Driven by a passion for travel, they set out to escape the dreary routine of everyday life. They want to achieve maximum self-fulfilment without big safety nets and full-cover insurance, in a nomadic world of adventure. Pete is a DJ, so parties and big cities are a defining part of his life, whereas Suparni aka Supi is the opposite; she‚Äôs looking for spirituality and awareness. The two show us the huge spectrum of opportunities that the world of the digital nomad has to offer. Despite their fundamental differences, they both earn their living by working remotely. The digital age has made this way of life possible: without the Internet, it would be almost unthinkable. But their lifestyle does have its limits, as is becoming especially evident to Suparni with her plans for parenthood. But it's hard to find someone you love who also loves the same sort of lifestyle, and the constant travel is a big obstacle.

6hhaoTNu2a4,Madeira Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Madeira-Island.d11326.Destination-Travel-Guides

Pushed by volcanic forces from the sea floor into the warm trade winds of the North Atlantic, are the dramatic cliffs of Madeira. Volcanic activity may have settled millennia ago, but the island‚Äôs rich soils and spring climate means Madeira explodes in lush vegetation all year round. 

Madeira‚Äôs capital, Funchal, was named after the wild fennel which once carpeted its hillsides. Walk streets paved with patterned stonework that evokes the spirit of Portuguese culture and pride. Explore centuries-old churches and homes, which have endured pirate raids, German U-boat attacks, and earthquakes. 

From Funchal, head west to Cabo Gir√£o, one of the world‚Äôs mightiest cliffs. You‚Äôll find colossal views just a fifteen-minute drive east of Funchal too. At Garajau, watch divers far below enjoying the undersea gardens of the marine reserve. 

Madeira‚Äôs ring road strings together coastal towns and beaches, each one a little different from the last. If you‚Äôre looking for the island‚Äôs sunniest spot, head to Ponta do Sol. If you‚Äôve got a sweet tooth, head to the old sugar town of Arco da Calheta and enjoy a honey cake. And if the rumbling sound of breakers is your idea of relaxation, spend a night or two at Paul do Mar.

Madeira‚Äôs northern coastline offers plenty of drama and adventure too. Feel the power of the Atlantic in the natural swimming pools of Porto Moniz. If you‚Äôre keen on hiking the levadas into the mist-covered interior, the town of Seixal makes an ideal base. 

Less than an hour‚Äôs drive from Funchal is Pico do Arieiro, Madeira‚Äôs third highest peak.
From here, experienced hikers can follow knife-edged trails to even higher peaks, the same peaks that guided Portuguese mariners to Madeira six centuries ago.",travel

MRI8ffYKA8c,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d178316.Destination-Travel-Guides

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

DEJx0CYrDHk,Rome Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"As legend has it, Rome, Italy, was founded by the twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, in 700 B.C. The former Caput Mundi, or Capital of the World, sits beneath Palatine Hill, where the ruins of its original incarnation are open for exploration.

No Rome tour is complete without stopping by the remains of the Temple of Saturn and Arch of Septimus, both located in the Roman Forum. Get in touch with your inner gladiator and stop by the Colosseum, a relic of Roman bloodsports and perhaps the most recognizable element of the city.

Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain to ensure you‚Äôll return to Rome one day; don‚Äôt toss in two coins unless you‚Äôre ready to fall in love with a Roman. Continue your Rome sightseeing in St. Peter‚Äôs Square, home of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica. The world‚Äôs largest church, designed by Michelangelo, is both a remarkable structure and a tribute to faith. You can look down from the famous dome to the Holy Square, which is usually filled with the faithful looking to obtain a blessing from the Pope. After this, it‚Äôs just a few steps to restaurants filled with Italian food. Forget coming back to Rome ‚Äì you‚Äôll never want to leave.

What‚Äôs your favorite memory of Rome?

QSwvg9Rv2EI,Chicago Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Chicago.d178248.Destination-Travel-Guides

Chicago, once a small trading post on Lake Michigan, has grown into one of the country‚Äôs most famous cities. Visit ‚ÄúThe Windy City‚Äù and chow down on deep dish pizza for a truly unique vacation experience.

Follow ‚ÄúThe Loop,‚Äù the city‚Äôs primary business district, and marvel at its array of high-rise buildings, consulates, and universities. Shopping and fine dining abound in this area. If you‚Äôve worn yourself out in the city proper, set a more sedate pace at the Riverwalk, a pedestrian path along the Chicago River, or visit the many museums and parks the city has to offer. You‚Äôll never believe you‚Äôre actually downtown when you walk through the Garfield Park Conservatory, and the Art Institute of Chicago will allow you to appreciate creative works from around the world.

No Chicago tour is complete without a mention of the nightlife, so close out your day at a jazz lounge and let the sweet sound of music carry you away. Visit our Chicago travel guide and plan your next vacation today.

1PGiixdhNVk,Portland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Portland.d178299.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Portland, Oregon, where you can experience the laid-back atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest amid beautiful natural surroundings.

A Portland tour is easily accomplished on foot; this city was designed for pedestrians, so you‚Äôll be able to get around quickly. As you stroll along, you‚Äôll find plenty of parks, fountains, and buildings old and new to explore. Be warned, this city is known for its sudden showers, so make sure you bring an umbrella to shield yourself until the sun makes a triumphant return.

If you like a good brew, you‚Äôre going to love Portland‚Äôs alter-ego, Beervana ‚Äì so named thanks to all the breweries located here. Wine snobs, don‚Äôt despair; you‚Äôll find plenty to drink (responsibly) in the Willamette Valley while you continue your Portland sightseeing. 

If you‚Äôre here with the kids ‚Äì or you just really love animals ‚Äì don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Oregon Zoo, home to eagles, bobcats, and a ton of other feathered, furry, and scaled critters. Travelers with children will also love the Portland Children‚Äôs Museum, where the little ones can learn from and play with interactive exhibits. 

Whether you‚Äôre here for the beautiful views or to responsibly sample the vintages in the valley, Portland has something for everyone. What are you going to do when you get there?

Visit our Portland travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

ka-ZgwCXKho,Venice Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Rising from the waters of Venice Lagoon is the Italian city of Venice, a city like no other.
Begin your visit in the central district of San Marco, and walk upon one of the world‚Äôs great squares, St Mark‚Äôs Square. The square is surrounded by some of the city‚Äôs finest jewels such as St Mark‚Äôs Basilica, St Mark‚Äôs Campanile and Doge‚Äôs Palace. 
 
Just outside stand the Columns of San Marco and San Teodoro. From here, journey along one of the world‚Äôs great aquatic thoroughfares, The Grand Canal. Glide past elegant palazzos; once the homes of wealthy merchants, today many of these palaces house important museums and galleries. 
 
Known as The City Of Bridges, Venice has hundreds to explore. The Accademia Bridge links the San Marco district to the Accademia Gallery, and offers some of the Grand Canal‚Äôs finest views. The oldest of the Grand Canal‚Äôs four crossings is the Rialto Bridge, which today still serves as the gateway to the Rialto Markets. The most famous of all is the Bridge of Sighs, which connects Doge‚Äôs Palace to the historic prison.
 
Venice is a city to get lost in, so put away your map and let her surprise you. Discover waterfront promenades of The Zattere and the sleepy canals and spacious piazzas of Castello. On the tiny island of Murano, glassmakers have been creating works of incredible delicacy and color for over 700 years. Further across the lagoon, the island of Burano is famed for its brightly colored houses and exquisite lace.
 
Venice has shone her light into the far corners of the world for over one and a half thousand years. Just remember, this city smiles upon those who linger. So stay for a few nights, or stay for a month, and savor every moment she has to offer.

KtuTa8N3GZk,Alaska Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Alaska.
Alaska is a country situated on the edge of the Arctic and dream destination for wildlife and nature lovers who answer to the call of the wild.  A land of bears, glaciers, pioneers and prospectors on the northern tip of the American continent. In Vancouver, Canada‚Äôs pearl of the Pacific Ocean, begins an extraordinary journey along the Alexander Archipelago in the Gulf Of Alaska, a charming capital with European flair.  In English Bay a giant metal crab guards the planetarium and by aquabus our journey travels across False Creek to Science World with its marvellous glass globe that contains a museum of modern art. Ketchikan is a small town located five hundred and twenty six nautical miles north of Vancouver and was founded by the Tlingit Indians.  In the 1880‚Äôs the town based its economy on salmon and timber but today relies upon tourism. Since 1900, Juneau has been the capital city of Alaska, the forty ninth state of the U.S.A.  In 1880, Joe Juneau, Richard Harris and their Tlingit Indian leader, Chief Kowee, discovered gold in Gold Creek and the gold rush began. Glacier Bay was completely covered by ice and glaciers around four thousand years ago during the Little Ice Age.  The ice melted and the ever-changing glaciers are today situated within the arms of the bay which stretches almost a hundred kilometres to the north. Barrow is the northernmost point of inhabited North America and five hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.  The living conditions in the arctic wastelands are extremely harsh and most of the year it is bone-chillingly cold. Even today the promise of untamed nature and boundless freedom attracts us to America‚Äôs final wilderness.  Alaska is full of wild extremes and stark contrasts, a fascinating land of pure adventure!

tVflvbwKdHU,Cancun Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Cancun.d179995.Destination-Travel-Guides

Surrounded by the warm waters of the Yucatan Peninsula, Cancun is famed for its sunshine, history, and wild nightlife. Come to this former Mexican fishing village turned resort town to join legions of fellow sun worshippers ‚Äì just don‚Äôt forget to pack sunscreen.

Your Cancun tour should stop at the Acuario Interactivo, where you can meet mariachi-singing dolphins and other friendly sealife. Explore the vast historical offerings of Cancun by heading to the Yucatan interior, where you‚Äôll find ancient Mayan cities available to tour. A day trip to Chichen Itza, one of the world‚Äôs Seven Modern Wonders, is another must. Wander through its ancient streets and take in the temples, an observatory, and even a sporting arena.

At sunset, your Cancun sightseeing will come to a dazzling conclusion amid the wild nightlife. Watch shows, go dancing, attend parties, and make sure you‚Äôve got your camera out. It all begins anew the next day; morning in Cancun means more time to make sun-drenched memories that will last a lifetime.

What‚Äôs your first stop in Cancun going to be?

XhHwGolzQmg,Hawaii&#39;s Big Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Hawaii.d180074.Destination-Travel-Guides

The ‚ÄúBig Island‚Äù of Hawaii is the largest of the Hawaiian Islands, and offers a fascinating and stunning array of beautiful scenery for you to explore.

Sightseeing on Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island means your days will be filled with natural wonders: wander around a lava field, stroll through a tropical rainforest, and take a dip in the warm waters of the Pacific. To get the most out of your Hawaii Big Island tour and to get an idea of what areas you‚Äôd like to see up close, we suggest renting a car and exploring Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island from behind the wheel. The Onomea Bay Scenic Drive, located along the Hamakua Coast, will take you past shimmering emerald rainforest and astonishing glimpses of the tranquil Pacific Ocean. It‚Äôs the perfect place to get some pictures and see what the beauty of Hawaii is really about.

No tour of Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island is complete without meeting the sea turtles of Kahalu‚Äôu Bay. Strap on your mask and snorkel, and swim around the warm, blue-green waters of the bay to get up close and personal with the turtles and thousands of other sea creatures. If hanging out with the sea life isn‚Äôt entirely your cup of tea, you can also try paddleboarding, jet skiing, or a variety of other watersports. Alternatively, you can spoil yourself in the time-honored indulgence of relaxing on the black lava sands, soaking up some of the legendary Hawaiian sunshine.

What will you do on Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island?

When ready, check out vacation packages to Los Cabos: https://www.expedia.com/Los-Cabos.d180032.Destination-Travel-Guides



A tale of two towns on the very edge of Baja California Sur, Los Cabos is synonymous with relaxation and recreation. But when the team at Expedia made the voyage here, they found more than just a beautiful vacation destination.
They uncovered new shores, geological monuments, and exciting experiences. They encountered a region with diverse and welcoming people, vibrant art culture, world-class cuisine, and of course, a thrilling nightlife. 

For a romantic secluded escape, consider the arty San Jose del Cabo, a cultural hub bursting with inspiring art, Spanish colonial architecture and sheltered shores. 

If you are chasing the fiesta, check in to a hotel in Cabo San Lucas. Every sunset brings a new party to the sands and the streets here, so don‚Äôt forget to pack your dancing shoes.

_EkO2ofPOXg,Jordan Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"Want to know what goes into creating one of the Expedia Vacation Travel Guide videos? Check out how we made Jordan here: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/video/jordan-video-behind-the-scenes/

https://www.expedia.com/Jordan.d90.Destination-Travel-Guides

The ancient Greeks knew Jordan‚Äôs capital, Amman, as Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Overlooking Amman is the Citadel, the city‚Äôs ancient core. Rising over the Citadel are the remaining pillars of the Temple of Hercules, a Roman temple that in its day dwarfed many in Ancient Rome.  

 

From Amman, journey north to Jerash, home to one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Italy. Then, continue north to Ajloun Castle, built to halt the Crusader armies as they rode down Jordan‚Äôs northern valley, hell-bent on Jerusalem.

 

Enter the gravel plains of the Eastern Desert and follow the Desert Castle Loop. For many, the highlight here is Qasr al-Azraq, where Lawrence of Arabia made his winter headquarters. 

 

Travel south to Madaba, famed for the Madaba Map, one of the earliest depictions of the Holy Lands. Continue south along the Kings Highway, which once took Arabs to Mecca, and Israelites to the Promised Land. 

 

Follow the hairpin road 1300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea. Float in the saline waters and cover yourself in the same mineral-rich muds Cleopatra once enjoyed. 

 

No visit to Jordan is complete without a visit to Petra. Emerge from the shadows of the Siq and gaze up at the Treasury, the greatest of all of Petra‚Äôs 500 tombs. Then continue south to explore the emptiness of Wadi Rum. 

 

From epic landscapes to monumental ruins, Jordan allows us to reach out and touch the eternal, and be at one with something far greater than ourselves.",travel

Things everyone does on snapchat they don't want to admit!
First, everyone uses filters when they aren't looking their best. Whether you just woke up or are having a bad hair day, snapchat filters will cover it all! Next, we've all looked into getting surgery to look like that snapchat dog right...? oh just me? Just kidding, I really hope no one has done that. Third, we've all redone a ""candid looking"" snapchat because we didn't like the angle, how our hair looked, etc.

The Bali Travel Guide serves as a guide and inspiration for people looking to travel to Bali for the first time. The Bali guide suggests sights to see, activities to do, or dishes to eat. It includes my top things to do and places to visit in Bali and is based on my travel to Bali during the summer of 2017. I spent roughly two weeks on the island visiting Ubud, the Gili Islands, and Seminyak. 

I tried to add as much helpful information as I could, which I hope provides a good idea on how to travel Bali or at least serve as a form of inspiration. If you have any suggestions or feedback feel free to comment below, as any feedback is appreciated, I hope you find the video useful. Don't forget to like and subscribe for more content!

0ohZyqgIyQI,India (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 42.161 Hotels in India - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2EaPS2P

Travel video about destination India.
India is a subcontinent with a long history, a land of legend, fantasy and reality.A country that extends from the Himalayas in the north to the semi-desert terrain and tropics of the south. A place of incredible contrasts and fascinating splendour. Delhi is the political and administrative capital of India and a melting pot of both culture and religion. A constantly expanding metropolis built on the site of twelve former cities and centre of power for almost a thousand years. Jama Masjid, the Friday Mosque, is one of ancient Delhi‚Äôs main landmarks that was bequeathed to the city by the mogul king, Shah Jahan and close to the mosque is the bazaar district of Chandni Chowk, a busy commercial area. The white temples of Ranakpur are the sanctuaries of the Jains and are situated in a picturesque valley to the west of the Aravalli Mountains north of Udaipur. At around the same time that Buddhism was introduced to the area, Jainism also arrived, the religion of the country‚Äôs great hero, Mahavira. Rajasthan is the Land Of The Maharajas in all its splendour, a living fairytale beneath the desert sky. Agra was once the imposing metropolis of the mogul monarchy and today the city has lost nothing of its mediaeval atmosphere. Calcutta, or Kolkata, as it has been known since 2001, is the capital of West Bengal and also the second largest city in India. A city of contrasts that could not be more striking. Each morning hundreds of people go to the Howrah Bridge to bathe on the banks of the Hooghly River, a tributary of the sacred River Ganges. In 1853 Bombay had its first railroad and the Indian rail network was soon extended. The Victoria Terminus was built, one of the most impressive train stations in the world. Incredible India, a remarkable country that has always fascinated travellers by the amazing diversity of its people, culture and landscapes.

a4d5CbK0b3A,Vancouver Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vancouver.d178315.Destination-Travel-Guides

Vancouver‚Äôs breezes carry the scents of nature and aromas of all the urban delights you‚Äôd expect from a city regularly voted, ‚Äúthe Worlds most livable‚Äù.
 
The city takes its name from the British navigator who landed here in 1792.  The original settlement was called ‚ÄúGastown‚Äù, in honor of Gassy Jack, who built the city‚Äôs first tavern. Gassy Jack and his makeshift pub may be long gone, but in the historic neighborhood of Gastown, his spirit lingers on.
 
Vancouver‚Äôs early history continues at Waterfront Station, the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway‚Äôs construction brought Chinese workers by the thousands, whose descendants have enriched Vancouver ever since. Experience this interweaving of cultures in Chinatown, where the fusing of Oriental flavors with local seafood has helped earn the city the title, ‚Äúthe Culinary Capital of Canada.‚Äù
 
After visiting Vancouver‚Äôs central highlights, ride the ferry to Granville Island. Stock up on provisions at the Granville Island Public Market and sample craft ales at Granville Island Brewing. From Granville Island, head to Queen Elizabeth Park on Little Mountain, a peaceful oasis high above the city.
 
When it‚Äôs time to answer the call of the wild, cross the Lions Gate Bridge to The North Shore, a wilderness where bears roam and salmon-filled rivers flow through old-growth forests.  Less than a two-hour drive from the city is Whistler Blackcomb Resort, the largest ski resort in North America. The beautifully connected runs here cater to all skill levels and attract elite skiers and beginners from all over the globe.",travel

72__Mdioty8,Hong Kong Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Hong-Kong.d178263.Destination-Travel-Guides

Hong Kong, a former British territory, is one of the most densely populated places in China and in the world. You‚Äôll find quiet neighborhoods full of temples and a dazzling skyline loaded with shopping and dining opportunities.

Your Hong Kong tour must include visits to the many religious sites scattered around the city, where incense wafts from shrines and monasteries take over entire hillsides. You‚Äôll have a marvelous time shopping in tax-free Hong Kong, where you‚Äôll be able to find clothing, jewelry, furniture, and everything else under the sun. 

Don‚Äôt forget about Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, which overlooks the stunning Victoria Harbor. From there, your Hong Kong sightseeing may detour to Central, the city‚Äôs main business district, which looks like something out of a sci-fi film. The observation deck atop the International Commerce Centre will show you fantastic views of the city.

Hong Kong isn‚Äôt all cityscape, of course; there are many gardens, parks, and other green spaces for you to explore. You‚Äôll also find beaches, national parks, and quiet islands for you to indulge in natural beauty and serenity. This city truly has everything.

rGKf1NhtJ1o,Queenstown Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Queenstown.d180018.Destination-Travel-Guides

Queenstown, in New Zealand‚Äôs South Island, is the gateway to stunning fiords, glaciers, ski fields and vineyards. This lake-side city provides the pulse that keeps this remote corner of the world energetic and youthful. As the descendants of fierce Polynesian warriors and determined European settlers, the Kiwis have the spirit of adventure running though their veins. 

Experience the beauty of Lake Wakatipu aboard the TSS Earnslaw. Nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Lady of the Lake‚Äù, for over 100 years this steamship hasn‚Äôt missed a beat, transporting livestock and passengers to and from the High Country. Back in Queenstown, soak up the Aotearoa sunshine on a sandy beach or in Queenstown Gardens. For a bird‚Äôs-eye view, ride the Skyline gondola to Bob‚Äôs Peak. Then when the sun gets low, head to Marine Parade and enjoy Mother Nature‚Äôs spectacle with kindred spirits from all over the world. 

Queenstown expands and contracts with the rhythm of the seasons. After the hectic summer, the town transforms into a world-class ski destination. Queenstown has three main ski fields; The Remarkables Ski Field, Cardrona Alpine Resort and the Coronet Peak Ski Area.

When the snow melts, Queenstown transforms again to accommodate visitors who flock to the Arrow Basin to explore its charming historic towns. The Kiwis know when it‚Äôs time to slow down, unwind and enjoy the finer things in life. Queenstown and the nearby Gibbston Valley are home to over 75 wineries, where vintners produce pinot noirs acclaimed for their purity, freshness and vitality, a perfect reflection of the region itself!",travel

AlCqyZEXM1I,Travel More &amp; Buy Less. | Luis Vargas | TEDxPortland,"We live in a world of consumption. Before you buy your next item for your ""man cave"" or ""she shed,"" think again. Adventure and exploration is the best way to learn and expand your horizons. The idea here is simple and enlightening, that one should have a passport full of stamps rather than a house full of stuff. Travel more. Buy less. #GO

With special thanks to the UNIVERSITY OF OREGON for presenting partnership, a world class stage design provided by HENRY V, an incredible legacy bound book provided by PREMIER and to the creative digital craft provided by ENJOY THE WEATHER. All of our Partners and event history can be found TEDxPortland.com 

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)

Luis was born in Mexico City, grew up in California and found home in Oregon. He has spent 20 years working around the World in the digital start-up and adventure travel space helping iconic brands like Disney, REI, and The Clymb create meaningful experiences-based businesses. His purpose is to inspire and enable others to have transformative travel experiences, with the knowledge that travel can be a force for good.

The third Space Rock Mix is now available:  
https://youtu.be/J__y6k7a5ZQ

This is the second relaxing Psychedelic/Space Rock mix I've made. The first one https://youtu.be/iuWa5wh8lG0 was released about a year ago and it got insanely popular, clocking in at 3 million views at the time I'm writing this! 

This mix is pretty much the same but with others tracks and pictures. Some artists makes a well deserved return but there are also new ones in the mix.

You'll find the tracklist, timestamps and links to each artist below in the description and in the first comment under the video. You will also find links to every picture I used in the video in the pinned comment below. Please give the musicians your support if you find anything you like in the video. My last space rock video has really helped a bunch of bands to sell records and it was all thanks to you guys!

This has worked perfectly fine for me the past 3 years that I've had Precheck. :)

wW2y79D-9vk,Brunei (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 7 Hotels in Brunei - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2DEK6VA

Travel video about destination Brunei.
Brunei Darussalam is a tiny sultanate in the north of the island of Borneo located on the shores of the South China Sea and is surrounded by the Malayan federal states of Sabah and Sarawak. The capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, is like something from an exotic fantasy.

The splendour of the mosque of Sultan Omar Ali Saiffudin is a captivating sight. This Islamic landmark is also a symbol of great wealth and was built in 1958 and was named after the father of the present sultan. Snow white Italian Carrara marble was used as building material, with granite from Shanghai. It commemorates the founder of modern Brunei.

On a classic longboat powered by outboard motor, we travel on the Brunei River and are soon surrounded by mangrove brush. Tropical thunderstorms and monsoon rain create dense vegetation and the ensuing humidity produces lush flora.

At the junction of two muddy-grey waterways of the Brunei River is an historic location, Kampung Ayer, a water village. Each building and adjoining pathway is built on posts yet there is both an electricity and drinking water supply. Plants decorate the terraces, and TV aerials are everywhere and it has a population of around thirty thousand.

Brunei is a land that has almost lost its history while moving into modern times. It is a country that has grown amazingly wealthy since its gas has hissed and its oil has spluttered from deep below the ground. Liquid gold - Allah be praised!

wuwEFQuYOUo,Hong Kong Travel Tips: 11 Things to Know Before You Go,"11 things YOU need to know before you go to Hong Kong. A comprehensive travel guide to bring you up to speed on the Weather, Language, Getting Around, and more! Hong Kong was originally a British Colony founded in 1842, taken over by China in 1997. Hong Kong‚Äôs Official Name is the ‚ÄúSpecial Administrative Region of Hong Kong.‚Äù In Chinese Hong Kong Means ‚ÄúFragrant Harbor.‚Äù Hong Kong is Famous for Skyscrapers (it has 8,000 of them), but 40% of it‚Äôs land is park and nature preserve
Hong Kong has 3 main areas, Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories
But in total it has 263 islands

2 - Weather
Hong Kong's climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius in winter and exceeding 31 degrees Celsius in summer
Pretty humid all year round
May to November is typhoon season
June & August are the wettest
January and December are the dryest

3. Getting In
Likely flying in to Hong Kong International Airport - HKG.
 
It‚Äôs on Lantau Island, and its HUGE!  The size of 20 soccer fields.
 
You can fly to almost anywhere in the world from Hong Kong (more than 100 airlines operate 1,100 daily flights to and from 190 destinations worldwide) 
 
Cathay Pacific is Hong Kong‚Äôs home airline and has won ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Airline‚Äù four times ‚Äì more than any other.

Airport Express train to Central - Its just 24 minutes, and leaves every 10 minutes
You can buy a round trip airport Express and Octopus card for 3 days unlimited MTR for $350

Taxi one way to Hong Kong Island would be about $400 HKD and take 45 mins to an hour

4. Unlucky
This number omitted because it‚Äôs unlucky.  4 in Chinese sounds like the word for ‚ÄúDeath.‚Äù  Most buildings typically omit this floor.


5. Getting Around
By public transit‚Äîit's efficient, clean, and affordable
First things first, buy an Octopus Card -- It works on almost everything, even to get you in to the Hong Kong Horse Racetrack
MTT - Subway
Star Ferry - About $3 HKD, Upper Deck & Weekends cost a bit more.
Tram - Ding Ding - $2.60
Double Decker Bus
Mini Bus
Taxi - Relatively inexpensive, but can be hard to hail during rush hour, or a rainy day, or shift change between 3-4pm.
Don‚Äôt try to hail a cab if you see double yellow lines by the curb. Taxis can only stop if there is a single line‚Äîor none at all.
Uber


6. Money
Hong Kong Dollar
Exchange Rate fixed to the USD.  1 USD = HK$7.75‚Äì7.85
Most places take Visa/Mastercard
40% take AMEX
Lots of ATMS -- Hong Kong is a huge financial center after all
Bills: Issued by 3 different banks, so you‚Äôll see 3 different designs for all the bills
HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000
Coins: 


7. Language
2 Official Languages
1.Chinese, (Spoken Cantonese)
2. English
 
In the major urban districts, most residents will speak English but Cantonese is the local language
 
If you think you‚Äôre planning to learn a little Cantonese before you go‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not easy‚Ä¶ it has nine tones.

8. Shopping

Shops often stay open late‚Ä¶ none of this European 6pm closing time‚Ä¶ think 9 or 10pm closing times for most shops and malls

9. Food:

Cantonese Food
And it‚Äôs all about sharing, portions are big and made for big groups
Dim sum originated here in southern China and means ‚Äútouch the heart‚Äù. These tiny bites of goodness were created as snack food for travellers and today are an essential part of local culture.
Dim Sum
Hong Kong Milk Tea

Dai Pai Dong, Fast Food Noodle Shops, are common sites in Hong Kong offering an inexpensive bowl of noodles for around HK$20 and free tea

 Bones -- yes, lots of the local food has bones it.  At the casual restaurants you can just put the bones on the table.  At a fancier restaurant use the saucer plate beneath your bowl

Tea -- Need a refill for your teapot?  Turn the lid upside down.

Like to avoid the crowds?  Then avoid eating lunch between 1-2pm, that‚Äôs the typical Hong Kong lunch hour

10. Feng Shui
The mystical art of feng shui is still common practice in Hong Kong -- wondering why a building‚Äôs architecture looks weird?  The answer usually has to do with Feng Shui‚Ä¶ that might be why your hotel lobby has a water feature and some goldfish in it too!

11. I‚Äôve got more videos!

Ready for an adventure? Click play on our travel guide video to uncover some of the best things to do in Syndey, Australia. 

Established in 1788 as a penal colony, Sydney was once a little rough around the edges, but it has since transformed into a must-visit coastal destination. Today, tourists flock to this city on the east coast of Australia for its pristine beaches, coves, and harbors. 

During your romp around the scenic coastline, make a stop at the Syndey Opera House and eye its magnificent architectural design. Looking for a little more adventure? Venture over to the Syndey Harbour Bridge, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Coathanger,‚Äù and brave a bridge climb tour. Next, hop on the antique thrill rides at Luna Park, which is a family-friendly favorite that dates back to 1935, or saunter around Darling Harbour. Meanwhile, if you‚Äôd prefer to make a splash, dive into the waves at Bondi Beach or hang ten at nearby Manly Beach. 

Dabble in the city‚Äôs history, architecture, and beach towns, and embark on several Sydney tours during your next trip to the capital of New South Walves. To jump-start your adventure and get more tips and ideas on how to spend your Sydney sojourn, check out our travel guide video.

cS-hFKC_RKI,Tokyo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Tokyo.d179900.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Tokyo, the capital of Japan and the epitome of the word ‚Äúmegacity.‚Äù

In this vast metropolis, ancient traditions blend with futuristic buildings, and your Tokyo sightseeing will take you to representations of each. Pay your respects at temples set in forested hillsides, then flex your credit card in one of the shopping districts, before sitting down to a five-star meal‚Ä¶all in one day.

Your Tokyo tour begins with the subway and train system, which will take you all over this sprawling city. Tokyo is home to some 35 million people, many of which you‚Äôll meet as its public transit carries you throughout its many neighborhoods. Make a stop in Asakusa, a temple district nestled in leafy trees with skyscrapers towering in the background. There you‚Äôll visit Nakamisi Dori, a street loaded with food vendors and religious charms. Get to know the city a little better in the Harajuku district, home to cutting-edge fashion, a thriving, youth-centered culture, and the famous Yoyogi Park. The park stands out in stern contrast to the rest of the neighborhood; this sprawling, 134-acre green space is where locals slow down after a frenzied week of work and play.

 As night falls, make your way to Shinjuku. Many of Tokyo‚Äôs premier restaurants and pubs span Shinjuku‚Äôs streets, and you can indulge in succulent 5-star meals or sample with fast food from local vendors. Watch a movie, do some karaoke, and linger with fellow travelers and friendly locals alike.

What was your favorite part of Tokyo?

qvuv6bg9dgQ,OUR BIGGEST TRAVEL FAIL! | Day 4 | Vietnam Vlogs 2019,"When you‚Äôre young, it makes sense to go out on a limb and do something more adventurous when traveling abroad. You see the backpackers on Instagram living it up in Asia, travel bloggers living the nomad lifestyle, and it looks so fun, easy and exciting. When I imagined our trip to Ha Long I imagined all of that. 

We booked a homestay (AirBnB of Vietnam) for one night in Ha Long before our cruise in the bay the next day. I figured we had the accommodation set up. Now all we had to do was get there and start exploring. It‚Äôs 2019, this should be easy with smart phones and google maps and Grab (Uber of Vietnam). Ha. Umm. Well‚Ä¶ 

Let's just say the entire day was one big fail.

lqSoLVkYYu0,Traveling Iran by train | DW Documentary,"Iran is opening its doors to foreigners and a train ride from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea is a great way to get to know the country and its people.

The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life ‚Äì and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. 

The country‚Äôs most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.

Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.

During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.

In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin‚Äôs major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea.

A-63Yawo0zI,Learn English - Travel Vocabulary,"http://www.engvid.com/ Learn important, basic words you will need when you travel. Knowing a little English vocabulary can help a lot when you are travelling. Whever you are going in the world, you can almost always find someone who speaks some English. I'll teach you how a ""tourist attraction"" is different from a ""tourist trap"". What about ""sight seeing""? Do you know what an ""itinerary"" is? Do you have your travel documents? Get ready for your English to take flight! http://www.engvid.com/travel-vocabulary/

Hi. James, from EngVid. I was just about to plan my vacation. I'm going to take a long flight to Europe. I'm trying to remember luggage and baggage things, you know? It's kind of hard to do. But this is a lesson for you if you've been working a lot, you need some time off. Now, there's a video I would like you to go check out. That's on time off. It goes with this one. You might want to go away somewhere and not just stay home, right? So this video is for you. This is basic vocabulary on vacation. When you leave and maybe you go to an English speaking country and you want to practice your English, this stuff will be good for you to enjoy your time there, also to make it easy for you when you arrive. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Mr. E, Mr. E! It's a mystery where he is. It's no mystery. And you thought I forgot. Mr. E has been on vacation with me, and he's enjoying this particular attraction. So let's go to the board.

Now, if you're going to go on vacation, one of the first things you will have to do if you're leaving your country is you're going to need some travel documents. What are those? Documents. A ""document"" is a paper or something with information that tells you something is okay or outlines it for you. For example, your passport is a document given by the government with your picture on it that says you are a citizen of this country, and you are legal. You are a good person. Okay? Now, when you're leaving for a flight, or you want to go to another country, you're going to need travel documents first. Trust me; show up at the airport and go, ""I leave now. I go to Canada."" They will go, ""And the car is that way. Go home, crazy man. Okay?"" So we need travel documents. So what are ""travel documents""? Well, ""travel documents"" would be your passport, government identification, usually needed at most places the travel. Inside of a country, not necessary for most places. But leaving the country, you have to have it. Okay? So if you're in the European Union, no problem. If you're in Canada and the United States, you don't need one. But as soon as you leave these countries, you need a passport.

What's another thing you need? Well, you need what's called a ""boarding pass"". If you play soccer, you kick the ball; the other guy, he catches it; you ""pass"" right? The ball goes from one player to another. A ""boarding pass"" is what allows you to go from one country to another country. You show the person on the airplane this piece of paper with your passport, and they say, ""You know what? You can come on the plane and fly, like the pass."" Kick, catch, other country. Cool? All right. So these are your travel documents. You need those.

Now, I should have started with you need to make a plan because you want to go visit some place. You want to go on vacation, right? And if you want to go on vacation, well, going to have to -- I said ""vacation"". A ""vacation"" is a holiday, another word for saying ""time off from work"". All right? So you want to go on vacation. Sometimes, we say, ""We're going to vacation in Italy."" Or ""on my vacation, I want to visit Italy."" Or ""I'm taking a holiday in Italy."" Okay? So all these words, when people say, ""Well, what are you doing on your time off?"" You might go, ""I'm going on vacation."" Then they know you're leaving. If you just say, ""I'm taking time off from work"", you could be home cleaning. But no. You're saying, ""I'm going on vacation."" They're going to go, ""Where are you going to visit? Italy, perhaps? Sicily? Is it going to be a good holiday?"" And you go, ""Yes. I earned my time."" ""Earned"" means to work for something. ""I earned my time off. I'm going on vacation.""",travel

The Panama Canal is a 77.1-kilometre (48 mi) ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean (via the Caribbean Sea) to the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 metres (85 ft) above sea level. The current locks are 33.5 metres (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks is currently under construction and is due to open in 2016.

France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States took over the project in 1904, and took a decade to complete the canal, which was officially opened on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. The shorter, faster, and safer route to the U.S. West Coast and to nations in and around the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy. It takes between 20 and 30 hours to traverse the canal.

During construction, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American‚ÄìPanamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999, and is now managed and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a Panamanian government agency.

Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax. The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.",travel

I'm not sure if I will be able to keep it up, but here goes nothing. I'm just a 20 something year old girl who dropped out of college to pursue a lifestyle on the internet. Lately I've been waking up finding myself unsatisfied with what I am doing. Like most people my age, I have no clue what to do with my life.

Amsterdam is the largest city in The Netherlands, also known as Holland. The fun-loving Dutch welcome 3.5 million tourists a year, making Amsterdam one of the top destinations in Europe.

No Amsterdam tour is complete without exploring some of its 165 canals and 1,000 bridges ‚Äì hopefully you like water. Don‚Äôt worry; you don‚Äôt need a boat or even a motor vehicle to get around. The heart of this ancient city is best seen on foot or from the seat of a bicycle. This city is rich in history; when you set out to explore ‚ÄúThe Venice of the North,‚Äù you‚Äôll find buildings dating back to the 13th century, as well as Dam Square and its royal palace. 

If you‚Äôve got an appreciation for fine art, your Amsterdam sightseeing should pause at the Rijksmuseum, where you can find the works of Rembrandt and other Dutch masters. Up for a pint? Stop by the old Heineken Brewery and learn about the lager brewing process. If you‚Äôre really feeling daring, grab a coffee in De Wallen, better known as one of the world‚Äôs oldest red light districts. You won‚Äôt get into trouble with your partner if you head there these days; it‚Äôs now home to cafes and adult stores.

Deloreons, blue boxes, hot tubs, we are obsessed with time travel. While mainstream science wants us to believe that time is linear, some are saying that‚Äôs not quite it. Perhaps it is because we are so desperate to want to go back into the past and change our mistakes, or even try to change history itself! Time travel has been, and will always be, a major plot device for fiction. Books and movies will always come up with a new way for their characters to travel through time. But is it possible that time travel could actually exist? According to physicists, time travel does indeed exist and it‚Äôs already happened...several times! Why hasn‚Äôt this made the news? Well, think about it; if there‚Äôs word that time travel is possible, could you imagine the public outcry that would happen? People would say that the past happened for a reason that wasn‚Äôt natural and demand that we go back in time. What if a rip happened in the space-time continuum? There‚Äôs theories that Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves are time travelers too!

In this video, we‚Äôre going to tell you about ten theories that prove time travel actually exists. From disappearing aircraft carriers to modern technology popping up in ancient Greece and Egypt, these stories present a pretty compelling argument that we have the capability to hop around all over the timeline. There are video clips dating back to the early 1900‚Äôs of people walking around and talking on cell phones! Where did they even get their reception? Take a peek at this video and see what we‚Äôre talking about.

ABOUT ME:

Hi there, my name is Dia. 
I left Los Angeles in late 2017 and have been traveling ever since. I began making videos to keep myself grounded, and since then it has turned into my dream career! Taking the leap to chase my dream was scary at first, but sharing my stories and adventures with you guys have been an amazing part of it.

I hope to continue making travel vlogs and valuable guides to help and inspire others. Would love to get to know ya! Drop a comment and say hi :)

With ancient streets full of exotic cars, a natural harbour filled with super yachts and a glittering royal legacy, Monaco is a tiny relic of medieval Europe that has made itself at home in the 21st century.

The Panama Canal is a 77.1-kilometre (48 mi) ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean (via the Caribbean Sea) to the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 metres (85 ft) above sea level. The current locks are 33.5 metres (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks is currently under construction and is due to open in 2016.

France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States took over the project in 1904, and took a decade to complete the canal, which was officially opened on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. The shorter, faster, and safer route to the U.S. West Coast and to nations in and around the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy. It takes between 20 and 30 hours to traverse the canal.

During construction, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American‚ÄìPanamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999, and is now managed and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a Panamanian government agency.

Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax. The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.",travel

I'm not sure if I will be able to keep it up, but here goes nothing. I'm just a 20 something year old girl who dropped out of college to pursue a lifestyle on the internet. Lately I've been waking up finding myself unsatisfied with what I am doing. Like most people my age, I have no clue what to do with my life.

Deloreons, blue boxes, hot tubs, we are obsessed with time travel. While mainstream science wants us to believe that time is linear, some are saying that‚Äôs not quite it. Perhaps it is because we are so desperate to want to go back into the past and change our mistakes, or even try to change history itself! Time travel has been, and will always be, a major plot device for fiction. Books and movies will always come up with a new way for their characters to travel through time. But is it possible that time travel could actually exist? According to physicists, time travel does indeed exist and it‚Äôs already happened...several times! Why hasn‚Äôt this made the news? Well, think about it; if there‚Äôs word that time travel is possible, could you imagine the public outcry that would happen? People would say that the past happened for a reason that wasn‚Äôt natural and demand that we go back in time. What if a rip happened in the space-time continuum? There‚Äôs theories that Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves are time travelers too!

In this video, we‚Äôre going to tell you about ten theories that prove time travel actually exists. From disappearing aircraft carriers to modern technology popping up in ancient Greece and Egypt, these stories present a pretty compelling argument that we have the capability to hop around all over the timeline. There are video clips dating back to the early 1900‚Äôs of people walking around and talking on cell phones! Where did they even get their reception? Take a peek at this video and see what we‚Äôre talking about.

cS-hFKC_RKI,Tokyo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Tokyo.d179900.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Tokyo, the capital of Japan and the epitome of the word ‚Äúmegacity.‚Äù

In this vast metropolis, ancient traditions blend with futuristic buildings, and your Tokyo sightseeing will take you to representations of each. Pay your respects at temples set in forested hillsides, then flex your credit card in one of the shopping districts, before sitting down to a five-star meal‚Ä¶all in one day.

Your Tokyo tour begins with the subway and train system, which will take you all over this sprawling city. Tokyo is home to some 35 million people, many of which you‚Äôll meet as its public transit carries you throughout its many neighborhoods. Make a stop in Asakusa, a temple district nestled in leafy trees with skyscrapers towering in the background. There you‚Äôll visit Nakamisi Dori, a street loaded with food vendors and religious charms. Get to know the city a little better in the Harajuku district, home to cutting-edge fashion, a thriving, youth-centered culture, and the famous Yoyogi Park. The park stands out in stern contrast to the rest of the neighborhood; this sprawling, 134-acre green space is where locals slow down after a frenzied week of work and play.

 As night falls, make your way to Shinjuku. Many of Tokyo‚Äôs premier restaurants and pubs span Shinjuku‚Äôs streets, and you can indulge in succulent 5-star meals or sample with fast food from local vendors. Watch a movie, do some karaoke, and linger with fellow travelers and friendly locals alike.

What was your favorite part of Tokyo?

Established in 1788 as a penal colony, Sydney was once a little rough around the edges, but it has since transformed into a must-visit coastal destination. Today, tourists flock to this city on the east coast of Australia for its pristine beaches, coves, and harbors. 

During your romp around the scenic coastline, make a stop at the Syndey Opera House and eye its magnificent architectural design. Looking for a little more adventure? Venture over to the Syndey Harbour Bridge, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Coathanger,‚Äù and brave a bridge climb tour. Next, hop on the antique thrill rides at Luna Park, which is a family-friendly favorite that dates back to 1935, or saunter around Darling Harbour. Meanwhile, if you‚Äôd prefer to make a splash, dive into the waves at Bondi Beach or hang ten at nearby Manly Beach. 

Dabble in the city‚Äôs history, architecture, and beach towns, and embark on several Sydney tours during your next trip to the capital of New South Walves. To jump-start your adventure and get more tips and ideas on how to spend your Sydney sojourn, check out our travel guide video.

p0iehiwf228,Ethiopia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Ethiopia.
Ethiopia is a mysterious, mountainous land in the Horn Of Africa and birthplace of Early Christianity.  A country of rock churches in the north and a large variety of tribes along the Rift Valley in the south and the oldest civilised region in Africa with more than twenty five centuries of documented history. Addis Abeba is the capital of Ethiopia and within its centre is the lavishly furnished Menbere Selassie Church, final place of rest of Ethiopia‚Äôs last royal family.  It contains the Empress Menen, two princes and Emperor Haile Selassie who, shortly after removal from power, died due to reasons that are in the main controversial. On many of its thirty seven islands, Lake Tana in Northern Ethiopia is well known for its ancient churches and monasteries.  Dega Stefanos is located in the centre of the lake and contains one of the country‚Äôs most important monasteries.  On the summit, framed by walls and hidden under great trees, is the Holy Stefanos Monastery and within a small sanctuary various mummies are preserved within glazed wooden coffins and the remains of five emperors of various dynasties lie at rest. Awash is a settlement on the edge of the nature park of the same name, inhabited by the Afar, a proud and independent tribe.  On market day, people from the surrounding area meet here.  For the Afar, life is hard and only the strong survive.  Corn, tobacco, dates and cotton are the main trading products of this region.  Dromedaries, sheep and goats are bred, and pastureland is often the subject of heated disputes. A journey through Ethiopia is also a journey through time itself.  A land of rich traditions, religions and myths.  A country of legends and contrast that possesses one of the most colourful histories on the African continent.

lF8byCyRJ2g,London (United Kingdom) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 12800 Hotels in London - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2DFsetA

Travel video about destination London in England.
London is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.

The City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.

After the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.

The Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.

Since the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.

The highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.

The former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.

Transcript:

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it‚Äôs one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver‚Äôs clean air is thanks to it‚Äôs really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn‚Äôt just a place, it‚Äôs a way of life. But it‚Äôs a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we‚Äôre going to help you make the most of it! We‚Äôre going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let‚Äôs get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward ‚Äì a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain ‚Äì it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

Now it‚Äôs not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There‚Äôs ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn‚Äôt too bad in our experience.",travel
lqSoLVkYYu0,Traveling Iran by train | DW Documentary,"Iran is opening its doors to foreigners and a train ride from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea is a great way to get to know the country and its people.

The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life ‚Äì and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. 

The country‚Äôs most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.

Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.

During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.

In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin‚Äôs major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea.

8P-iPXsylrk,Traveling Ecuador by train | DW Travel Documentary,"The train line through Ecuador is considered one of the most spectacular train lines in South America. A train journey of discovery.

The Trans-Andean railroad takes in the infamous Nariz del Diablo, or Devil‚Äôs Nose, a mountain with almost perpendicular walls. To overcome this obstacle, the train zigzags to ascend 500 meters in less than 12 kilometers. With steep ascents and descents, it‚Äôs no ride for the faint-hearted! The main line along the country‚Äôs Andean spine links the coastal city of Guayaquil with the capital Quito. It was finished in 1908, but was mostly shut down after a series of weather-related disasters destroyed much of the Ecuadorian rail network in the 1990s. After extensive restoration, a new cross-Andean service was opened in 2013, following the original narrow-gauge line. It‚Äôs 450 kilometers long and runs from the Pacific coast up to the Andean highlands. On its cross-country journey, the train is accompanied by guards on motorcycles who, in the absence of railway gates, stop traffic at every level crossing along the way to let the train pass. The Tren Crucero, - or ""cruise train""- is the centerpiece of Ecuador‚Äôs rejuvenated railway. A revamped luxury steam train, it runs once a fortnight and has room for 54 passengers. The most exhilarating stretch of the ride begins deep down in the gorge of the River Chanch√°n. The train zigzags up the Nariz del Diablo - the ""Devil's Nose"" - in a series of dizzying switchbacks in which the tracks almost seem to lie on top of each other. Join the reporters for the ride of a lifetime, as the train journeys on to Urbina, the highest station at 3,609 meters above sea level, and along the so-called Avenue of Volcanoes, to the Cotopaxi National Park and onwards to Quito, the world's highest capital.

Amsterdam is the largest city in The Netherlands, also known as Holland. The fun-loving Dutch welcome 3.5 million tourists a year, making Amsterdam one of the top destinations in Europe.

No Amsterdam tour is complete without exploring some of its 165 canals and 1,000 bridges ‚Äì hopefully you like water. Don‚Äôt worry; you don‚Äôt need a boat or even a motor vehicle to get around. The heart of this ancient city is best seen on foot or from the seat of a bicycle. This city is rich in history; when you set out to explore ‚ÄúThe Venice of the North,‚Äù you‚Äôll find buildings dating back to the 13th century, as well as Dam Square and its royal palace. 

If you‚Äôve got an appreciation for fine art, your Amsterdam sightseeing should pause at the Rijksmuseum, where you can find the works of Rembrandt and other Dutch masters. Up for a pint? Stop by the old Heineken Brewery and learn about the lager brewing process. If you‚Äôre really feeling daring, grab a coffee in De Wallen, better known as one of the world‚Äôs oldest red light districts. You won‚Äôt get into trouble with your partner if you head there these days; it‚Äôs now home to cafes and adult stores.

There is a lot of conflicting information out there on the different websites for the dimensions of the suitcases. We wanted swivel wheels as well as the biggest carry-on that the airlines would allow. For each of the carryon suite cases, we examine the size, pockets, webbing, and handle.

Almost all airlines in 2018 state that the maximum carry-on suitcase dimensions are 9"" x 14"" x 22"". Two of these options actually measure larger, but we took them to the airport and tried them in the American Airlines, Allegiant Air, and United Airlines sizer bins to test them out.

9J4a37-h9Y8,Long Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/Long-Island.d602887.Destination-Travel-Guides

Long Island stretches eastward for 115 miles, from the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to the bluffs of Montauk Point.
¬†
Take the short train ride from Manhattan to the sands of Long Beach, which for many is where¬†Long Island¬†begins. From here, Long Island‚Äôs protective barrier islands continue all the way to Westhampton Island. Halfway along the chain, visit Fire Island Lighthouse, which for generations of immigrants was their first glimpse of America.
¬†
Many of those immigrants went on to create vast financial empires, and it was on Long Island‚Äôs¬†northern shores¬†where they built the mansions that would inspire F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs classic,¬†The Great Gatsby.
¬†
At the Cradle of Aviation Museum in nearby Hempstead, discover how Long Island launched generations of aviators into the wild blue yonder. Nearby, continue your flight into the past at the American Airpower Museum.
¬†
In the mid 1800s, well-to-do New Yorkers were drawn to the unspoiled beaches of Long Island‚Äôs East End. Today, the pioneer settlement of Southampton Village is a place where history and style have blended as smoothly as the spirits in a Long Island Iced Tea. The past been also been beautifully preserved in nearby Sag Harbor, a historic whaling port immortalized in Moby Dick.
¬†
Just a 30-minute drive east from Sag Harbor is Montauk, a place locals refer to as ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù. America‚Äôs first president, George Washington, commissioned Montauk Lighthouse on Long Island‚Äôs easternmost point. Climb to the top to take in the sweeping views of this place that has played center stage in some of America‚Äôs greatest stories.",travel

From its days as a Phoenician outpost to its expansion into a 16th¬†century trading giant, from the Great Earthquake of 1755 to its glorious reconstruction, Lisbon has long been a city of shifting fortunes.
¬†
Lisbon has forever been linked to the sea and it‚Äôs on the waterfront where you‚Äôll find the city‚Äôs grand gateway, Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio. Pass beneath the triumphal arch, a tribute to the city‚Äôs reconstruction, and drift down Rua Augusta to another of Lisbon‚Äôs great squares, the Rossio.
¬†
Climb aboard Tram 28, which passes some of the city‚Äôs most iconic sights, then climb the battlements of Castelo de S√£o Jorge to see the red tiled roofs of Lisbon spread out before you.
¬†
Although the Great Earthquake reduced much of Lisbon to rubble, the ancient suburb of Alfama was spared. Lose yourself amid the cobblestones, where cafes, bars and artisan shops have taken residence in the dockworkers homes of old. As the sun gets low, join locals in a fado bar to hear heartrending songs of the working class.
¬†
20 miles west of the city is Cascais, a sleepy fishing village until Lisbon‚Äôs nobility discovered its golden bays in the late 1800s.¬†¬†Another playground for Portugal‚Äôs Monarchs was Sintra, which¬†Hans Christian Andersen¬†called the most beautiful place in Portugal.
¬†

After Sintra,¬†spend a few days exploring some of Europe‚Äôs most beautiful beaches, such as Praia das Ma√ß√£s, Adraga and Ursa.¬†At Cape Roca, stand upon the clifftop, which until the 14th¬†century was considered¬†the end of the world.",travel
ZwcnQ0d667I,Peru Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Peru.
Lima is the capital of Peru, the second largest country in South America after Brazil and Argentina.The Palacio De Gobierno is also known as Pizzarro, or Government Palace. This Neo-Classic building was completed in 1938 and stands on the foundation of the former Pizzarro Palace. In the palace gardens is the house in which Pizzarro was killed. Lima, the City of Kings, became the capital of the largest region in Spanish South America and was where the viceroys of the Spanish crown resided. During colonial times this city was the largest, most populated, finest and most cultivated city on the continent. Some of the most beautiful colonial buildings in South America are to be found in Lima‚Äôs old town along with carved balconies of Moorish origin. Huaraz is the 3,050 metre high capital of the Departamento Ancash in the White Mountain range, the Cordillera Blanca. Several natural catastrophes destroyed the majority of the old houses and many people were killed. In 1824 Simon Bolivar built his headquarters there prior to his bloody struggle for Peru‚Äôs independence. The valley oasis of Nazca which played an important role during the early history of Peru is a desolate area in the south of the country. A small airport is the starting point of a journey to one of the world‚Äôs greatest mysteries, the enigma of Nazca culture: images of humans, animals and geometric forms scattered over an area of 1,000 km¬≤ like the pages of some fantastic historical and astronomical book, created by the Nazca between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D.The 8,300 km¬≤ Lake Titicaca is located at an altitudeof 4,000 m in the Andes Mountains on the border that divides Peru and Bolivia. Then there‚Äôs Machu Picchu, the Lost City Of The Incas! Peru is a country full of mystery and ancient history. A land of mountains, desert and jungle. A precious gem on the edge of the world!

TRANSCRIPT

Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's video I'm going to talk about something I love, and that is travel. So, if you like travelling too, if you're planning on going on a vacation, or if you know somebody who's travelling, this video will be very, very helpful to you. In this video I'm going to teach you some very important verbs. They're all phrasal verbs, and I'll explain what a phrasal verb is in a moment. So, these are all verbs that we use when we're talking about travel. Okay.

So, to get started, I wanted to tell you a little bit about phrasal verbs. What is a phrasal verb? One of the difficulties students have with English are verbs where you have a verb and a preposition. So, when you see a verb and a preposition together, that's a phrasal verb. Now, you might be thinking: ""What's a preposition?"" Good question. I'm going to give you an example. We have here four words, each of these is a phrasal verb. They all have the verb ""get"": ""get in"", ""get up"", ""get on"", ""get over"", and there's many more, ""get away"". There's tons of them. Each of these actually can have multiple meanings, too. So, one of the most difficult parts about English is learning phrasal verbs, because this, the blue part is the preposition, it can change the meaning of the verb. Okay? So, prepositions are words like: ""on"", ""off"", ""up"", ""down"", ""toward"", ""over"", ""away"", these types of words are prepositions. So, you'll notice with phrasal verbs, they're very, very common in conversation. They're... You can write them down, too, but in general, when people talk they often use phrasal verbs. Okay? So, they're very, very important, especially when you're talking about going on a trip with your friends or family.

So let's look at some of the common phrasal verbs we use when we're talking about trips. The first verb I want to teach you: ""Drop off"". Okay? So: ""drop"" is the verb, ""off"" is the preposition, together: ""drop off"" is a phrasal verb. What does this mean: ""drop off""? When you ""drop someone off"" it means you're taking them to a place and then you leave them there. So, for example, maybe your friend needs to go to the airport, so you drive them to the airport and you drop them off at the airport. This means you take them there and you leave them in that place. Okay? So they don't come home with you; they stay there. So, for example, I have a friend named Frank, and when Frank goes travelling: ""We drop Frank off at the airport."" So, we drive Frank to the airport, he has all his luggage, his suitcases, and then we say to Frank: ""Goodbye, Frank, you know, have a nice trip."" We drop Frank off at the airport. You can also use ""drop off"" in a lot of other situations. For example, when you were a child maybe your parents, your mom or your dad, or maybe your grandparents dropped you off at school. This means that they took you to school, and then once you got to school, they would say goodbye to you and they would leave. So: ""drop off"" means you take someone to a place, and then you leave them there. You'll also notice... So, I have here the verb and the preposition. ""Frank"" is a name of a person and it's in the middle of ""drop"" and ""off"". Okay? So, these two are not together. We drop somebody off at the airport. Okay? So, sometimes with phrasal verbs... For some phrasal verbs you actually separate them, and you can put the names of somebody between them; for other ones you can't do that. For this one: ""drop off"", you put the name between the two... Between the verb and the preposition.

So, now let's look at another example of a common phrasal verb. ""See off"". Okay? So, again, we have ""off"" in both of these. ""See off"" is when... It's similar to ""drop off"", but it's a little bit different. Sometimes your family or your friends are going away for a long time, maybe they're going on a vacation or a trip, so you want to ""see them off"". It means you want to say goodbye to them at the airport, at the train station, maybe at their house. So, it's that goodbye you say before somebody goes off on a vacation. Okay? So, for example: ""We see Frank off."" Frank is going to Australia, so we go to the airport because we want to say goodbye to Frank, so: ""We see Frank off"" is another way to say: ""We say goodbye to Frank when he goes on his trip.""",travel
9pfEQCBAP-Q,Barcelona (Spain) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 2.975 Hotels in Barcelona - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2tnZ2Tf

Travel video about destination Barcelona in Spain.
Barcelona is one of the most lively harbor cities on the Mediterranean and after Madrid, Spain's second largest city and the capital of Catalonia. Intimate squares, small palaces and tangled alleys provide a good insight into its history as Iberians, Greeks and Romans once had trading posts there.

La Rambla is a wide and shady boulevard that travels through the old town to the harbor and is where life goes on both night and day. It's also where street artists perform, shoeblacks work diligently and portrait painters tout for trade among the passing tourists.

The Museu Mar√≠tim is situated in the royal dockyards of Drassanes, that were built when the city was at its zenith. Its buildings are unique examples of Gothic architecture and the vast dimensions of the dockyard allowed 30 ships to be built simultaneously in the name of the Catalonian-Aragon crown.

Few parks are as famous as the Park G√ºell. With this, Antoni Gaudi created a new design concept in this fabulous garden city. At its entrance, Gaudi placed a colorful lizard as a symbol of the water that is collected in subterranean cisterns and is used for the distribution of water in the park. The city itself is also featured in Gaudi's magnificent fantasies. The Palau G√ºell was treated to an ostentatious roof with a great array of air shafts and chimneys. But the sight that captures the imagination of most who see it is the amazing fa√ßade of the Casa Mila, a unique apartment block without equal. Not a single wall is straight, glass and plaster were used for its fa√ßade and colourful ornamental ceramics complete the work.

Barcelona is a melting pot that ranges from Gothic to Modernism, a veritable explosion of joie de vivre and creativity.

9fJEFi3ccwI,Yosemite National Park Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Yosemite-National-Park.d180672.Destination-Travel-Guides

Yosemite National Park sits on the western slopes of California‚Äôs Sierra Nevada Mountains. Most visitors spend their time in Yosemite Valley, which despite being only 7 miles long and 1 mile wide, packs in more jaw-dropping scenery than just about any other place on Earth. 
 
Near the valley entrance stop at Tunnel View, and stand before a panorama that‚Äôs reduced generations of visitors to silence. From Tunnel View it‚Äôs just a short drive to Bridalveil Fall. Fed by snowmelt, the fall reaches its thundering peak in May. 
 
The Yosemite Valley ring road follows the banks of the Merced River, which shifts in character as it thunders from the valley walls, before gently winding across the valley floor. The ring road is dotted with trailheads that lead to 800 miles of hiking trails. The Four Mile Trail climbs the valley‚Äôs southern wall to two of Yosemite‚Äôs great outlooks, Glacier Point and Washburn Point. Further along the ring road is the trailhead for The Mist Trail, which offers stunning views of Vernal and Nevada Falls. 
 
For thousands of years, the Ahwaneechee had villages throughout this valley, but it was at the base of Yosemite Falls where their great chief resided. Take the one-hour hike to the lower falls, or spend the day climbing all the way to the upper falls.
 
To the north of Yosemite Valley, is Tioga Road, one of the USA‚Äôs most scenic highways. Fill your lungs with alpine air at Olmsted Point, refresh yourself by the waters of Tenaya Lake, then spend the day at Tuolumne Meadow, the traditional summer hunting grounds of the Ahwaneechee. 
 
From its high country to its waterfalls, its towering sequoia groves to its valley meadows, Yosemite is an American story unlike any other.",travel
Vm-MMki4sY4,Uzbekistan (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan is a country with thousands of years of history and contains all the magic of the Silk Road, as well as numerous oriental fairy tales, along with traditional culture, Islamic history and fascinating desert landscapes. Tashkent is the city of Amir Timur, the riding general who established a dynasty.  It is a city on the ancient Silk Road, famous in both orient and occident, and having inspired both scholars and poets, plus craftsmen and artists.  Modern Tashkent contains wide boulevards and plenty of lush greenery.  White storks that symbolize fertility crown the large entrance arcades to the Place Of Independence. Samarqand was the centre of one of the oldest forms of state in Middle Asia, and was located on the Silk Road.  Newly introduced Timurid style further enriched the architecture.  Coloured mosaics of astounding luminosity compete with glazed relief ceramics whose ornamentation is composed of arabesques, font characters and geometrical shapes.  Samarqand Bazaar now has a new, modern appearance and the variety of goods on offer has never been better with fresh fruit, vegetables, honey and cheese. The ‚ÄòWild West‚Äô of Uzbekistan is a wonderful region of deserts with just a few yurt camps for overnight accommodation.  Qirk Qiz Qala emerges from the middle of the flat, featureless desert.  Almost mystically, the final sharp fragments of the castle‚Äôs former defensive towers emerge from the ground which consist mainly of gravel and are covered with low saxaul bushes that defy the desert‚Äôs strong winds with their deep-reaching roots. The oasis city of Khiva is one of the greatest centres of ancient Korezm, ‚ÄòLand of the sun‚Äô, and was where mathematician Mohammed, who discovered algebra, once lived.  Almost fifteen hundred years of oriental culture are hidden within the intriguing winding streets of this fine oasis city. Uzbekistan has always been at the intersection of major trade and cultural routes and a border between Asia and Europe, between nomads and the Western world.  Exoticism mixed with all the magic of the One Thousand And One Nights!

kYXiegTXsEs,The value of travel | Rick Steves | TEDxRainier,"After spending 4 months a year for the last 30 years living out of a suitcase, Rick Steves reflects on the value of thoughtful travel. Sharing lessons learned from Iran to El Salvador and from India to Denmark, Steves tells why spending all that time and money away from home has broadened his perspective, enriched his life, and made it clear to him, as he says in his talk, ""Fear is for people who don't get out very much."" 

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",travel
Jd1wzlwtKJ0,Kyoto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Kyoto, Japan, has long been considered one of the country‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Once the capital of the nation, Kyoto is now an ultra-modern haven that retains a great deal of its ancient charm.

To see some of this long-established glamour, make your way to Kyoto Tower. Just two miles east of the tower is Gion, an entertainment quarter and home to many of Kyoto‚Äôs famous geishas. As you walk east through Gion, you‚Äôll find even more old architecture, including several Ryokan, or traditional Japanese inns. Many date back to the Edo period, which ranged from 1603 to 1868. 

During your Kyoto tour, take a rickshaw ride to the Sannen-zaka and Ninen-zaka districts, where cars are prohibited and traditional teahouses and temples adorn the nearby landscape. Kyoto is known as ‚ÄúThe City of Ten Thousand Shrines‚Äù for good reason. Walk through the great open plazas of the Haian Shrine, or spend a quiet moment in the intimate confines of the Shorenin Temple and its beautiful gardens.  

The most famous of Kyoto‚Äôs temples is Fushimi Inari-taisha, a stunning red complex that sprawls over Mount Inari, which is named after and dedicated to Inari, the fox spirit. A hike to the summit takes about two hours, and will lead you through thousands of colorful sub-shrines and thick, ancient forest. Once you‚Äôre at the top, you‚Äôll have a stunning view of Kyoto. 

What is your favorite part of Kyoto?

New Zealand has a lot to offer even the most particular traveller. From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough?

When you're in New Zealand, nearly ever adventure is only a stone's throw away. 

Make the most out of your visit to this remote island nation by assembling your bucket list with our travel guide. Booking a tour will ensure your trip is fun, flawless and stress-free: 
http://www.tourradar.com/d/new-zealand

New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries. 

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: http://www.newzealand.com/

---About New Zealand---

New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep.

The North Island is home to many hot springs and geysers while the South Island is mountainous, forested and covered in glaciers. Over 75% of New Zealanders call the North Island home, and more than 15% of New Zealand's energy comes from renewable resources.

8P-iPXsylrk,Traveling Ecuador by train | DW Travel Documentary,"The train line through Ecuador is considered one of the most spectacular train lines in South America. A train journey of discovery.

The Trans-Andean railroad takes in the infamous Nariz del Diablo, or Devil‚Äôs Nose, a mountain with almost perpendicular walls. To overcome this obstacle, the train zigzags to ascend 500 meters in less than 12 kilometers. With steep ascents and descents, it‚Äôs no ride for the faint-hearted! The main line along the country‚Äôs Andean spine links the coastal city of Guayaquil with the capital Quito. It was finished in 1908, but was mostly shut down after a series of weather-related disasters destroyed much of the Ecuadorian rail network in the 1990s. After extensive restoration, a new cross-Andean service was opened in 2013, following the original narrow-gauge line. It‚Äôs 450 kilometers long and runs from the Pacific coast up to the Andean highlands. On its cross-country journey, the train is accompanied by guards on motorcycles who, in the absence of railway gates, stop traffic at every level crossing along the way to let the train pass. The Tren Crucero, - or ""cruise train""- is the centerpiece of Ecuador‚Äôs rejuvenated railway. A revamped luxury steam train, it runs once a fortnight and has room for 54 passengers. The most exhilarating stretch of the ride begins deep down in the gorge of the River Chanch√°n. The train zigzags up the Nariz del Diablo - the ""Devil's Nose"" - in a series of dizzying switchbacks in which the tracks almost seem to lie on top of each other. Join the reporters for the ride of a lifetime, as the train journeys on to Urbina, the highest station at 3,609 meters above sea level, and along the so-called Avenue of Volcanoes, to the Cotopaxi National Park and onwards to Quito, the world's highest capital.

Few parks are as famous as the Park G√ºell. With this, Antoni Gaudi created a new design concept in this fabulous garden city. At its entrance, Gaudi placed a colorful lizard as a symbol of the water that is collected in subterranean cisterns and is used for the distribution of water in the park. The city itself is also featured in Gaudi's magnificent fantasies. The Palau G√ºell was treated to an ostentatious roof with a great array of air shafts and chimneys. But the sight that captures the imagination of most who see it is the amazing fa√ßade of the Casa Mila, a unique apartment block without equal. Not a single wall is straight, glass and plaster were used for its fa√ßade and colourful ornamental ceramics complete the work.

Barcelona is a melting pot that ranges from Gothic to Modernism, a veritable explosion of joie de vivre and creativity.

The largest town in southern Netherlands (and the fifth largest in the country), Eindhoven is well worth exploring. Known by locals as ""Lichtstad"" - the City of Light - due to its connections with electronics giant Philips (a monument near the station is dedicated to the company founder's son), this modern town is one of the country's industrial powerhouses. Located on the River Dommel, its rapid growth began soon after the establishment of the Philips works in 1891 and was cemented with the founding of the car and truck manufacturer, DAF. A busy university town, the city is home to a diverse collection of tourist attractions, from art museums to historic churches and lovely parks. It's also notable for its connection to Vincent Van Gogh who lived and painted in the nearby village of Neunen.

c4z6RZXv5p8,Interstellar Travel: Approaching Light Speed,"Is interstellar travel doomed to remain in the realm of science fiction? Sticking to near future space propulsion only, how close can we get to the speed of light?

This video looks at the current spacecraft speed records with Apollo 10 holding the record for the fastest manned spacecraft, New Horizons probe for the fastest Earth escape velocity and the Helios probes for the fastest heliocentric velocity. But Solar Probe Plus will beat that when it launches in 2018. While Voyager 1 doesn't set any speed records, it was the first spacecraft to leave the solar system, so therefore the fastest solar system escape velocity by default.

For beating these speeds, this video explores what is possible in the near future only, so no antimatter, Alcubierre drives (warp), ramjets, etc... The EM drive is left out until it's proven with actual reproducible results in space.

Project Daedalus and the updated Project Icarus represent sound concepts for fusion spacecraft. IKAROS was the first successful demonstration of solar sail technology but hopefully the planetary society is not far behind with their LightSail cubsat (not covered in this video).

But what appears to have the most potential to reach the nearest star to our own, Proxima Centauri and it's newly discovered planet Proxima b is Breakthrough Starshot. Thousands of super lightweight laser sail nanocraft will be launched into space then the light beamer, a ground based laser array will propel these spacecraft to 20% light speed within minutes.

iB4XbL_PmzQ,Atlanta Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Atlanta.d178232.Destination-Travel-Guides

Atlanta, Georgia, is home to 5.5 million people. When you venture into the lush foliage that engulfs much of Atlanta and frames its many skyscrapers, you‚Äôll immediately understand why it‚Äôs referred to as ‚ÄúThe City in a Forest.‚Äù 

An Atlanta tour must include the Atlanta History Center. Learn about the city‚Äôs roots as a railways terminal, as well as its role in the Civil War, when it was nearly burned to the ground. Fact became fiction when Margaret Mitchell featured Atlanta as a major setting in her novel, ‚ÄúGone With the Wind,‚Äù and you can learn about the author and the book at the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum.

Stop by the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site to learn about the Civil Rights leader, and pay your respects at his final resting place. From there, your Atlanta sightseeing should continue at the Georgia Aquarium, where you can meet some beluga whales, swim with whale-sharks, and get up close and personal with sealife in the touch tanks. 

Cap off a beautiful day with a trip to Stone Mountain Park. If you take the Summit Skyride, you‚Äôll get an outstanding view of the city.

wn89rYh09MM,Nice Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"When you plan a trip to Nice, France, you‚Äôre in good company: This city has been a tourist destination since at least the 18th century. The European aristocracy often spent their winters in the pleasant climate, with a sunset walk on the shoreline being the highlight of each day.

You can walk in their footsteps‚Äîliterally‚Äîwith a stroll down the Promenade des Anglais, which roughly translates to Walkway of the English. On a tour of Nice, you‚Äôll enjoy the mixture of French and Italian culture that permeates the city‚Äôs architecture, public art, and yes, the food. Bon appetit!

The residents of Nice love the outdoors, and you will, too, as you explore the Place Massena‚Äîthe city‚Äôs main square, where you can enjoy a snack at a caf√© or do some shopping in its many boutiques. Any Nice sightseeing requires exploration of one of the many open-air markets, where you can pick up fresh produce, local artwork, and French pastries that will leave you wondering why you waited so long to visit. 

Cap a perfect day in Nice with a dip in the ocean and a walk along the seashore, watching the sun disappear into the sea.

What are you going to eat while in Nice?

p0iehiwf228,Ethiopia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Ethiopia.
Ethiopia is a mysterious, mountainous land in the Horn Of Africa and birthplace of Early Christianity.  A country of rock churches in the north and a large variety of tribes along the Rift Valley in the south and the oldest civilised region in Africa with more than twenty five centuries of documented history. Addis Abeba is the capital of Ethiopia and within its centre is the lavishly furnished Menbere Selassie Church, final place of rest of Ethiopia‚Äôs last royal family.  It contains the Empress Menen, two princes and Emperor Haile Selassie who, shortly after removal from power, died due to reasons that are in the main controversial. On many of its thirty seven islands, Lake Tana in Northern Ethiopia is well known for its ancient churches and monasteries.  Dega Stefanos is located in the centre of the lake and contains one of the country‚Äôs most important monasteries.  On the summit, framed by walls and hidden under great trees, is the Holy Stefanos Monastery and within a small sanctuary various mummies are preserved within glazed wooden coffins and the remains of five emperors of various dynasties lie at rest. Awash is a settlement on the edge of the nature park of the same name, inhabited by the Afar, a proud and independent tribe.  On market day, people from the surrounding area meet here.  For the Afar, life is hard and only the strong survive.  Corn, tobacco, dates and cotton are the main trading products of this region.  Dromedaries, sheep and goats are bred, and pastureland is often the subject of heated disputes. A journey through Ethiopia is also a journey through time itself.  A land of rich traditions, religions and myths.  A country of legends and contrast that possesses one of the most colourful histories on the African continent.

In this video, we will share a 3-day travel guide on how we explored the city of Vienna during our second video. In this video, we cover the Vienna State Opera House, Schonbrunn Palace, Hofburg Palace, The Austrian National Library, Cafe Central, Prater, and more. 

Vienna is packed with so many great sites, museums, and food. While we did manage to pack a lot within our three days it means that we did have to leave some things out. We hope that this guide will help inspire and give you ideas about your next possible trip to Vienna.

AQ6GmpMu5L8,Paris Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Paris.d179898.Destination-Travel-Guides

Paris, the capital of France, attracts 42 million visitors a year. 

You can start your Paris tour on the metro, on foot, or with a taxi or bicycle; the city is easily navigable on all fronts. Visit the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the city and marvel at its graceful lines and commanding presence. Built between 1806 and 1836, the Arc is one of a number of historical arches and landmarks peppering Paris.

If your Paris sightseeing includes purchasing souvenirs, head to the Champs-√âlys√©es, home of boutique shopping, numerous restaurants, and many bars, along with a theatre and other entertaining venues. Learn about culture and creativity at the Louvre, a 14th-century palace turned art museum, and check in on the Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile. Notre Dame Cathedral cannot be missed, as this imposing Gothic structure has stood since 1345.

Speaking of imposing, the Eiffel Tower is most frequently used to represent Paris. Stroll beneath it to get a good idea of its height, or travel to the top for a stunning view of the City of Light.

LjOAE6FFVTo,Is Time Travel Possible?,"Is Time Travel Possible?
Subscribe: https://goo.gl/GmtyPv

Everyone has thought about time travel at least once in their life. Maybe you‚Äôve wanted to go back in time and try to change something from your past. There‚Äôs even a lot of science fiction movies out there that involve time travel, or were inspired by time travel in some way or another. But is it really possible to travel back or forward in time? And if it really is possible, what would we have to do in order to make time travel a reality? 

The very thought about time travel and what it would take to make it a reality is mind-boggling. It is something that scientists, especially astrophysicists, have long thought about. The most fantastic thing? It's probably possible. We should probably start off with the bad news about time travel. We probably can‚Äôt travel back in time and watch the Egyptians build the pyramids. However, there are a number of theories that have suggested that it is possible to take a leap forward in time. But going back in time is far more complicated. That‚Äôs not saying it‚Äôs impossible though. 

The great 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. While most people think of time as a constant, Einstein showed that time is an illusion; it is relative in that it can vary for different observers depending on your speed through space. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life, but other scientists have confirmed this theory. The theory says that space and time are really aspects of the same thing which is called ‚Äòspace-time‚Äô. There is a speed limit of 300,000 kilometers per second (or 186,000 miles per second) for anything that travels through space-time, and light always travels this speed limit through empty space. 

So more about this illusion of time, ‚ÄòSpecial Relativity‚Äô says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, especially when your speed relative to other objects is close to the speed of light. Time goes slower for you than for the people you left behind. You won't notice this effect until you return to those stationary people. 

So as an experiment, let‚Äôs say you were 15 years old and you left Earth in a spacecraft traveling at about close to the speed of light, and you celebrated only five birthdays during your space voyage. When you got home at the age of 20, you would find that all your classmates who were the same age as you when you left were 65 years old, retired, and hanging out with their grandchildren! The reason for this is because as time passed more slowly for you, you would have experienced only five years of life, while your classmates will have experienced a full 50 years.",travel

KtRsk4Bjs9s,Perth Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Perth.d180013.Destination-Travel-Guides

A modern city, Perth is the gem of Australia‚Äôs west coast and the capital of Western Australia. This friendly metropolis boasts pristine beaches, clear water, and plenty of coastline ‚Äì not to mention an abundance of nature and mineral resources.

Start your day of Perth sightseeing with a walk through Kings Park, which is larger than New York‚Äôs Central Park and home to the Western Australia Botanic Garden. More than 3,000 species of Western Australia‚Äôs plant life, including vibrant flowers, are on display here. Most of the park consists of bushland, which means lots of wildlife and quite a few walking trails.

After a morning of reflection in the park, head over to the Swan Bell Tower to enjoy a spectacular view of the city. Don‚Äôt forget your camera! You will notice the diverse nature of Perth‚Äôs architecture from this vantage point, including the modern glass structures and London-inspired Tudor buildings. 

Perth tours are never complete without a ferry ride to Rottnest Island, affectionately called ‚ÄúRotto‚Äù by the locals. This getaway is rife with opportunities to snorkel in the Indian Ocean, see wildlife such as seals and birds, and travel across more than 31 miles of cycle ways on a rented bicycle.

Once your feet are back on mainland Western Australia, visit one of the jewels, and ultimately what draws much of the Perth tourism: Swan Valley. This region has a landscape peppered with vineyards, no surprise given that growing grapes has been a long-standing tradition in Swan Valley. Following a short (or leisurely paced) day trip to Swan Valley, return to Perth and head to Hillarys Boat Harbour for a sunset dinner. 

What will you do in Perth?

IyBq4AdBKJI,Niagara Falls Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Niagara-Falls.d6023515.Destination-Travel-Guides

Niagara Falls has long been a symbol of natural power and beauty. Visit this hallmark of Canadian and American tourism and see its majesty from a helicopter, boat, or walkway.

Your Niagara Falls tour begins with a little bit of information: more than six million cubic feet of water spill over the sides per minute. You can explore three waterfalls, the most famous being the Canadian Horseshoe Falls, which are the widest and most powerful. Take a half-hour boat cruise and bask in the falls‚Äô mist, or enter a special set of walkways behind the falls and see the strength and might of the rushing water right in front of you.

No Niagara Falls sightseeing trip is complete without exploring the Botanical Gardens or Niagara on the Lake. The latter attraction offers boutiques, eateries, and picturesque views of the water you won‚Äôt soon forget.

7) Reichstag building

24) U-bahn and S-bahn metro system
25) Turkish Food 

The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining strip of the of the former dividing wall between East and West Berlin. Today the 1.3 kilometer long wall stands as a memorial to freedom and it is covered in art and graffiti. Right now we're visiting Brandenburg Gate.  This gate dates back to the 18th Century. We're here at Tiergarten, one of the biggest parks in the city. MauerPark is a hipster hangout. If you head over to the Bear Pit you can catch some karaoke and musical performances. If you want to spot some cool street art, then head over to Friedrichshain. You can't come to Berlin and not eat a Currywurst! This is the city's most popular fast food snack. The sausage is served with a ketchup and curry powder concoction. Up next we're at the Reichstag building which has a pretty cool glass dome on top.  This dome is actually open to visitors and it offers 360 degree views of the city. Today we're visiting Tempelhof, a re-purposed airport here in Berlin for leisure activities and sports. If you enjoy museums and art galleries you'll want to visit Berlin's Museum Island.  They actually have five different museums here and if you get a daily pass for 18 Euros you get access to all five. We are now visiting the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.  It is also known as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Charlottenburg Palace is the largest palace in Berlin and the only surviving royal residence in the city. Checkpoint Charlie was one of the crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. Located near Alexanderplatz, The Berlin TV Tower offers a great lookout over the city. Chocolate! Ritter Sport is a chocolate brand that is sold all over Germany, and while in Berlin we couldn't resist sampling a few of the different varieties. Berlin Cathedral is located on Museum Island and it's one of the most beautiful churches in the city. If Currywurst is to your liking, you'll want to check out this quirky museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage. Renting a bike is a great way to get around the city. Most places will rent out bikes at 10 Euros per day. For a leisurely afternoon, hop on a boat and enjoy a tour down the River Spree. Of course, you cannot come to Berlin and not eat a Wurst or a sausage. The Friedrichshain flea market takes place every Sunday and it's a great place for people watching and a little browsing. The Germans sure know how to enjoy a hearty breakfast, and we recommend you try it too. 
We couldn't resist visiting yet another cat cafe while we were in Berlin. 
While in Berlin we enjoyed a hearty meal of Schnitzel. It's quite easy to get around Berlin using the U-bahn and S-bahn system. In Berlin, there is a big Turkish population and that means there is awesome Turkish street food.  And that's Berlin for you! A city that has risen from the ashes of the war, which is now bursting with art, music, and life. 

Have you been to Berlin? We'd love to hear your favourite things about the city in the comments below.

YXz-erPr8B8,Montevideo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Uruguay is emerging as one of South America‚Äôs favorite destinations. Its capital Montevideo has a warm, temperate climate, pleasant sea breezes and miles of boulevards.

From Montevideo‚Äôs Telecommunications Tower you can see the hill that gave the city its name.

Another tower, the Palacio Salvo looms high above the Plaza Independencia in the City Center. Under this square is the mausoleum for the country‚Äôs revolutionary hero Jos√© Artigas.

Nearby Plaza Matriz is the city‚Äôs oldest square and home to the 18th-century Metropolitan Cathedral, the focal point of Uruguay‚Äôs Old Town.

Soccer is big here and in 1930 Uruguay hosted and won the first-ever FIFA World Cup in the Estadio Centenario.

Another proud local tradition is ‚Äúparrilla"" and the best way to try it is to buy cuts of meat in the Mercado del Puerto, and have those cooked for you on the spot.

The 19-mile long promenade, La Rambla leads to the city‚Äôs favorite playground: De Los Pocitos Beach.

To the west along the river is the UNESCO-listed Old Town of Colonia del Sacramento, with its landmark lighthouse, sleepy Plaza de Armas, historic Port√≥n de Campo and atmospheric Street of Sighs.

To the east of Montevideo, if you follow the coast, is Piri√°polis. This beach resort offers great views from its hilltop San Antonio Temple. 

The next highlight on this road trip is the lighthouse of La Paloma on the Cabo de Santa Mar√≠a peninsula.
On your way to the lighthouse of Punta del Este, don‚Äôt miss eccentric Casapueblo, a wonderful hotel and art gallery designed by local artist Carlos P√°ez Vilar√≥ in Punta Ballena.

Uruguay may be small, but its big heart and relaxing vibe create a lifetime of memories.

jeI3Ni7m46g,China Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination China.
China‚Äôs Imperial City is located in the centre of its ancient Middle Kingdom, a gigantic and inscrutable empire beyond the Great Wall. The Imperial City is entered through the Gates of Heavenly Peace.After seven years of construction, Ming Emperor Zhu Di moved into his newly-established palace complex in which over eight thousand people lived in almost a thousand rooms. The palace served as both a residential and governmental seat to the emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. A stone‚Äôs throw away from the old Summer Palace is the Garden of Harmonious Unity that was the favourite garden of the Emperor‚Äôs household who retreated to its cool lakeside shores during the humid months of summer. Close to Badaling the Great Wall Of China extends majestically across misty mountains. It is the largest Man-made structure in the world and was erected to protect the country from invasion from the North. The gigantic wall represented the division of two very different cultures. On one side the Central Asian Nomads and on the other the highly developed civilisation of the emerging Chinese Empire. Shanghai is a Gigantic City and a meeting point of both east and west. The shoreline is without a doubt the city‚Äôs main focal point and is a combination of past, present and future and contains the historic monuments and eye catching buildings of a great city. Famous explorer Marco Polo referred to Suzhou as the ‚ÄòVenice of the East‚Äô, a city that is particularly famous for its gardens. Many of its extremely elegant buildings are remnants of a glorious past. Yunnan¬¥s most famous site is the unique Stone Forest Of Shi Lin, a forest of rock that extends for 27,000 hectares. Hong Kong is a city of the superlative with glimmering skyscrapers that seem to take root in the sky and one elegant building after another with shining glass and hi-tech facades. China is a world within a world!

Banff, located in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies, is one part resort town and one part breathtaking natural retreat.

Life is a little different at over 4,600 feet in elevation‚Äîby the way, that makes Banff Canada‚Äôs highest town. During your Banff sightseeing, you‚Äôll learn that the town‚Äôs residents and visitors are a lively bunch, and you‚Äôll find the local businesses are perfect for this festive crowd. Choose from over 100 restaurants to dine at, or stop by one or two of the dozens of pubs and cafes for an inexpensive snack and drink after walking through the many boutiques. You can also enjoy a marvelous time after the sun goes down; try dancing the night away at the Dancing Sasquatch, or visiting one of Banff‚Äôs other nightclubs. 

Banff National Park is known for its wildlife, some of which frequents Banff itself. You‚Äôll often spot deer at the outskirts of town, some of which are friendly and curious about people. Once you say hello to the deer, make the drive to nearby Johnston Canyon, where you can take in snow-capped alpine scenery straight out of a fairy tale. 

Warm up after all this time spent outside: head to the Banff Upper Hot Springs. This exquisite spa has treated visitors to hot water and stunning views of the Rockies for over a century, and will continue to do so for a century to come.

What will you do on your Banff tour?

The following are the best 25 things to do in Berlin, Germany presented in our latest city top attractions travel guide:

http://nomadicsamuel.com/photo-essays/25-things-to-do-in-berlin

1) Visit Berlin Wall - The East Side Gallery
2) Brandenburg Gate
3) Tiergarten
4) MauerPark Flohmarkt (MauerPark Flea Market)
5) Friedrichshain
6) Currywurst 
7) Reichstag building 
8) Tempelhof
9) Berlin's Museum Island
10) Holocaust Memorial - the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe
11) Charlottenburg Palace 
12) Checkpoint Charlie
13) Alexanderplatz - The Berlin TV Tower 
14) Ritter Sport 
15) Berlin Cathedral
16) Currywurst Museum

21) Eat a German Breakfast
22) Cat Cafe (Pee Pees Katzen Cafe)
23) Schnitzel and Spaetzle
24) U-bahn and S-bahn metro system
25) Turkish Food 

The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining strip of the of the former dividing wall between East and West Berlin. Today the 1.3 kilometer long wall stands as a memorial to freedom and it is covered in art and graffiti. Right now we're visiting Brandenburg Gate.  This gate dates back to the 18th Century. We're here at Tiergarten, one of the biggest parks in the city. MauerPark is a hipster hangout. If you head over to the Bear Pit you can catch some karaoke and musical performances. If you want to spot some cool street art, then head over to Friedrichshain. You can't come to Berlin and not eat a Currywurst! This is the city's most popular fast food snack. The sausage is served with a ketchup and curry powder concoction. Up next we're at the Reichstag building which has a pretty cool glass dome on top.  This dome is actually open to visitors and it offers 360 degree views of the city. Today we're visiting Tempelhof, a re-purposed airport here in Berlin for leisure activities and sports. If you enjoy museums and art galleries you'll want to visit Berlin's Museum Island.  They actually have five different museums here and if you get a daily pass for 18 Euros you get access to all five. We are now visiting the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.  It is also known as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Charlottenburg Palace is the largest palace in Berlin and the only surviving royal residence in the city. Checkpoint Charlie was one of the crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. Located near Alexanderplatz, The Berlin TV Tower offers a great lookout over the city. Chocolate! Ritter Sport is a chocolate brand that is sold all over Germany, and while in Berlin we couldn't resist sampling a few of the different varieties. Berlin Cathedral is located on Museum Island and it's one of the most beautiful churches in the city. If Currywurst is to your liking, you'll want to check out this quirky museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage. Renting a bike is a great way to get around the city. Most places will rent out bikes at 10 Euros per day. For a leisurely afternoon, hop on a boat and enjoy a tour down the River Spree. Of course, you cannot come to Berlin and not eat a Wurst or a sausage. The Friedrichshain flea market takes place every Sunday and it's a great place for people watching and a little browsing. The Germans sure know how to enjoy a hearty breakfast, and we recommend you try it too. 
We couldn't resist visiting yet another cat cafe while we were in Berlin. 
While in Berlin we enjoyed a hearty meal of Schnitzel. It's quite easy to get around Berlin using the U-bahn and S-bahn system. In Berlin, there is a big Turkish population and that means there is awesome Turkish street food.  And that's Berlin for you! A city that has risen from the ashes of the war, which is now bursting with art, music, and life.

AZwGHEYT5x8,Austin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Austin.d178234.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Austin, home to nearly 900,000 people. The capital of Texas attracts a number of young, talented university students, which has prompted a good-natured culture war between the newcomers and the city‚Äôs longtime residents. So far, the latter group seems to be winning, thanks to their dedication to the Keep Austin Weird campaign. You‚Äôll find elements of this movement throughout the city in the shape of various art installations, eclectic eateries, and murals. 
 
An Austin tour means an adventure in the Live Music Capital of the World, home to festivals celebrating all kinds of tunes. Whether you‚Äôre here to listen to blues, country, or a little bit of rockabilly, you‚Äôre bound to find exactly what your musical palette desires in this quirky town. 

Austin is proud of its citizens, and throughout the city you‚Äôll find monuments of ranchers, prominent musicians, and Civil War heroes. Many of these monuments are located in Austin‚Äôs numerous parks, making it an excellent place to get in touch with nature. If relaxing by a fountain seems a little too bohemian for you, visit South Congress Avenue. ‚ÄúSoCo‚Äù is a veritable paradise anyone who loves vintage threads and just the right amount of ‚Äúweird‚Äù that makes Austin unique.

Don‚Äôt worry about keeping yourself fed ‚Äì as you‚Äôll notice in your Austin sightseeing adventure, you‚Äôll find a food truck on every street, and bistros, cafes, and restaurants just waiting for you to dive in and sample their culinary offerings. 

Whether you‚Äôre here for music, food, or to take in the local art scene, you‚Äôll find no shortage of things to do in downtown Austin. Have you been to any of its famous festivals?

vCQE-D6AqNY,10 Essential Travel Packing Tips &amp; Hacks - Minimalist Traveling,"How to Pack Light & Smart - Essential Travel Packing Tips for Minimalist Traveling.  Audible is offering our followers a free 30-day trial today.  Sign up to check out their audio books using our special link: http://www.audible.com/exploringalternatives

Want more travel packing tips?  Check out this NEW video we made for extra light minimalist travel: https://youtu.be/-PcrLWkxZSk  

After almost 5 years of travelling, we've come up with our 10 best travel packing tips to help you travel light, save money, and have an easy and comfortable trip.

1. Minimalist Travel Wardrobe

We choose clothes that are all in the same colour scheme and style so they can be layered to create different outfits for different situations and climates. In our experience, packing fewer clothes is always best and if you find that you're missing something, like a warmer sweater, you can always pick it up along the way.

2. Water

After buying and throwing out countless plastic water bottles on our travels, we finally said enough is enough.  It was a waste of money and plastic.  So we decided to get a portable water purifier (SteriPEN sent us one) and now we bring our own stainless steel water bottles with us and we purify tap water wherever we are.

3. Books and Guides

Books and guides are easily the heaviest things we carry on trips.  To downsize the weight in our backpack or suitcase, we try to bring smaller travel journals, we don't bring guide books (we use our iPod and free maps from airports and train stations to get around), and we're starting to try eBooks (free from the library) and audio books from Audible (our video sponsor!).

4. Staying Clean

When travelling, there are many times (for us at least) when we don't shower as often as we'd like, maybe a long 48 hour travel leg, or a nasty hostel shower that we don't want to use.  To stay fresh between showers, we use dry shampoo (the one in the video is from One Love Organics) and wet wipes (paraben-free).  We also always travel with Dr Bronners soap because we can use it for everything: showering, dishes, and laundry.

5. Souvenirs

We no longer buy souvenirs for our friends and family.  Instead, we try to send postcards to show people we're thinking of them.  It's cheaper, less wasteful, and we feel that it's more meaningful overall.

6. Passports

We've had a passport stolen, and another damaged by water.  We're not messing around with our passports anymore so we carry them in ziplock bags, inside a hidden passport pouch.

7. Food and Snacks

Food and snacks at airports and in touristy areas is usually overpriced and not necessarily healthy.  We try to pack our own food and snacks as much as possible (sandwiches, granola bars, hummus and crackers, oatmeal, roasted nuts, etc.) but it's important to check the rules about what you can bring and where.  

8. Electronics

When we're not travelling for work, we try to bring just our iPod touch.  We travelled for almost one full year with just the iPod & free wifi, and we did all of our hotel and flight bookings, and even a couple of visa applications on the tiny screen.  It's not perfect, but it saves us from lugging around a couple of laptops like we do now.

We also always travel with a flashlight. We have a Foxelli headlamp that is USB rechargeable and the battery lasts forever (they sent us the headlamp a couple of years ago and we love it).

9. Reusables

Travel has a pretty big environmental footprint and while we haven't quite gotten to the point where we're willing to stop just for environmental reasons, we do try to minimize flying and we travel with reusable containers to limit the amount of garbage waste we're producing.  We bring stainless steel food containers (by Onyx), water bottles, and coffee mugs, as well as cloth bags and cutlery.

10. Staying Healthy

We use natural remedies like oregano oil, garlic pills, activated charcoal, and essential oils to treat things like food poisoning, cold and flu, diarrhea, headaches, etc.  We also bring strong anti-nausea pills because Danielle gets motion sick in cars, planes, buses ‚Äî even a hammock once!

Thanks for watching!

Brian Cox says you can't travel into the past, but Nalini Joshi disagrees.

""Well, I don't know about whether there's an arrow that prevents you from going to the past or only into the future but, mathematically, I think that there are many, many possible answers to these questions. If I may? You know, if you take just a three dimensional cube and you look at one corner of this three-dimensional cube and then you compress one corner down to the diagonally opposite corner, then what you do is you flatten the cube and it becomes a hexagon. If you take that structure, which is hexagonally symmetric, it turns out that these types of symmetries are in crystals and there are a very knew few number of these regular symmetries that are exhibited in crystals in two dimensions. Now, if you think about increasing the number of dimensions, now go to three, four, five, six, presto, around 7 and 8 there are exceptional new structures that come up, that only exist when you get to 7 and 8 and maybe 9 dimensions.""",travel

For the second part of this track, we have formulated another set of frequencies dedicated for a deep, sound sleep and relaxation. Both parts contain the frequency of the Sun, 136.1Hz, which resonates the feelings of calmness, meditative, and centering. It is also connected to the Heart chakra to give you a sense of balance and harmony with the cosmos. As you finish your astral travels, you will find yourself falling into deep sleep and waking up feeling refreshed and energized.

One tip on how to do an astral projection is to repeat this phrase, ""Mind awake, Body asleep."" Let your body fall into slumber. It will feel numb and heavy at the same time. Do not be afraid of strange new sensations. For more tips on astral projection, read our blog:

hVfBQNENS9s,Berlin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Welcome to Berlin, the capital city of Germany.

The first documentation of Berlin appears in the 13th century, and it has a long history of importance‚Äîit‚Äôs been the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Kingdom of Prussia, among others. The lengthy history encompassing the city often manifests in its eclectic collection of architecture, which you should certainly include on your Berlin tour.

From the towering classical lines of Charlottenburg Palace, built for the Hohenzollern family in the 17th century, to the sleek mirrored sides of the Bahn Tower, you‚Äôre bound to find plenty to look at in the city‚Äôs downtown area. Fancy a real German lager? Stop by Prater Garten for a brew‚Äîbuilt in 1837, it‚Äôs one of the handful of buildings that has survived both World Wars. You can sit outside and responsibly enjoy your drink, or, if the weather turns on you, head inside to enjoy a hearty German meal. 

Ready to check out the rest of the city? You‚Äôre in luck. Berlin sightseeing is easy: Though the sprawling city has excellent public transit, Berlin is geared toward pedestrians, and you can access much of the city center on food or by bicycle. For a truly extraordinary experience, visit Museum Island, located in the Spree River. It features five museums, among them the Altes, completed in 1830 and devoted to antiquities. The newest structure on the premises, built in 1930, is the Pergamon Museum. Here you can explore the art of numerous cultures, or wander through a replica of the Ishtar Gate. 

Are you one of those people who only starts to wake up after the sun goes down? If you‚Äôre looking for a thriving nightlife, Berlin is the place to go. When the sun sets on the city, the party really begins, and you can find any number of clubs where you can dance until long after the sun comes up. 

Where will you go in Berlin?

Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.

20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.

So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.

Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.

For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.

So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.

The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.

Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city‚Äôs canal system.

Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. 

So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.

owI1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180020.Destination-Travel-Guides

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg‚Äôs fairytale setting.
¬†
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and¬†provided the settings for one of cinema‚Äôs most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
¬†¬†
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe‚Äôs best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you‚Äôll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
¬†
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf√© Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M√ºllner Br√§u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world.¬†
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg‚Äôs southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
¬†
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city‚Äôs most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe‚Äôs highest suspension bridge.
¬†
The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",travel

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",travel

nD_dFyfOXIo,Patagonia Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Travel to the land that time forgot and set out on the journey of a lifetime in Patagonia, where Mother Nature runs the show. 

Patagonia, the fabled ‚Äòedge of the world‚Äô, spans the southernmost regions of Chile and Argentina and can be rugged and desolate as well as breathtakingly beautiful and inviting.

This last frontier of South America is a colorful mosaic of snow-capped mountains,  icebergs, volcanoes, glaciers, forests, lakes and vast steppe plains.

On the Argentinean side, the scenic Road of the 7 Lakes takes you from San Mart√≠n de los Andes to Villa La Angostura and finally San Carlos de Bariloche, a popular ski resort on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi.

El Chalt√©n, in the southern Andes, is Argentina‚Äôs trekking capital. Trails lead to Laguna Capri, Fitz Roy Mountain and the fearsome Cerro Torre.

El Calafate is nestled the southern shores of Lago Argentino and is the gateway lake to Los Glaciares National Park. Here, one of the world‚Äôs most awe-inspiring glaciers awaits: the Perito Moreno Glacier.

In the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia, take the 'End of the World Train‚Äô to Tierra del Fuego National Park or get there by boat over the Beagle Channel. Photo opportunities along the way include Bird Island, Seal Island and the historic Les √âclaireurs lighthouse.

On the Chilean side of Patagonia, the regional capital Punta Arenas attracts visitors with its colonial architecture, cultural attractions and hospitality.

Tour the region‚Äôs Milod√≥n Cave, where the remains of a giant ground-dwelling sloth and other huge extinct species were found.

Torres del Paine National Park is great for horse riding or hiking, with its steppes, snowcapped peaks, brimming lakes and Salto Grande waterfalls.

On the northern border of Chilean Patagonia, in the Los Lagos region, looms the mighty Osorno Volcano. The town of Puerto Varas, on the opposite shores of Lake Llanquihue, marks the end your Patagonia expedition.

idg6vW3vXtE,Prague Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Prague.d180014.Destination-Travel-Guides

Step into a child‚Äôs storybook when you first arrive in Prague, a city in the Czech Republic where sleek, modern buildings share space with ancient gothic architecture. Wander down the twisting cobblestone streets ‚Äì you‚Äôre sure to find something new and exciting. After all, even locals get lost here.

Prague tourism usually involves the Royal Route, a historic coronation path that will take you through Old Town. Walk a few blocks to Old Town Square and sample local street fare in the shadow of old castles and palaces. Old Town itself is full of cafes, restaurants, and galleries, and will provide days of exploration for intrepid visitors.

Cross over the Charles Bridge and climb up to Prague Castle, a network of palaces, churches, and numerous museums. Be careful, as folks were a lot shorter back then ‚Äì you may have to duck your head as you walk through the low-ceilinged, artifact-filled halls.

Your Prague sightseeing must pause at St. Vitus Cathedral, a massive gothic structure dating back 600 years. You‚Äôll have to arch your back to see over 300 feet to the ceilings, which seem to vanish into the heavens. By the time you‚Äôre back outside, it will likely be twilight. You‚Äôll see pigs roasting on spits and people gathered under the statue of St. Wenceslas to share their daily adventures. The people here are friendly, so why not join them and chime in with your own stories?

Have you been to Prague? What would you like to do while there?

Following is the transcript of the video:

Brian Greene: I‚Äôm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.

It's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.

We know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It‚Äôs surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.

He also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity ‚Äî a neutron star, a black hole ‚Äî and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.

This is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel ‚Äî to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.

The main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really ‚Ä¶ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.

It's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole ‚Äî put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey ‚Äî then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel ‚Äî through this wormhole ‚Äî you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.

Now again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.",travel

Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
Canada is a stunning destination that provides travellers an endless natural playground to get lost in. From the incredible mountain ranges of British Columbia to the coves and cliffs of Canada's East Coast (and everywhere in between), the True North strong and free has it all.

The country is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories, each with their own unique cultural backgrounds, adventurous activities and impressive landscapes. Consider booking a tour that focuses on a specific region so that you can experience it thoroughly - the country is huge, making it unlikely to able to enjoy everything if you rush across the country in a single trip. 

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the province or territory you‚Äôre visiting. Depending on the season you travel, pack everything from your swimsuit to your parka. 

You can exchange your money into Canadian dollars in any major city, at airports or at the countless ATMs located throughout the country. Credit card and debit transactions are incredibly common, so in most case you will have no trouble using them in lieu of cash. Dining out doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you'll have to cross off the classics like poutine, sugar pie and craft beer! 

We'd like to thank a few of Canada's incredible tourism boards for allowing use of their travel footage:

Surrounded by the world‚Äôs highest mountains is a fascinating world whose exotic charm enchants all who experience it, from the plains of West Bengal up into the Himalayas. Siliguri is a vibrant city located within India‚Äôs Terai Plain, a peaceful provincial town with calm streets and shops that once supplied the region‚Äôs tea pickers with their daily needs, has been transformed into an important crossroads for travellers to the Himalayas. Siliguri Train Station is the starting point of one of the most famous train journeys in the world, the Darjeeling Himalaya Toy Train which climbs to an altitude of more than two thousand metres, negotiates eight hundred and seventy three bends and crosses more than five hundred bridges. Sikkim is strongly associated with Tibet and possesses more than two hundred monasteries.  The most holy monastery of the Nyingmapa Schools is in Tashiding and is located on a mountain in the east of the country along the route from Darjeeling. The independent kingdom of Bhutan is located in Southeast Asia, most of it being two thousand metres above sea level and is situated between India in the south and Tibet in the north.  Thimphu is the capital of Bhutan.  An array of prayer flags adorn a bridge in the centre of the city and close by is the large Tshonhkhang Marketplace, a colourful meeting place for both farmers and traders. For more than a thousand years Bhutan has survived in self-imposed isolation, cut off from the outside world by its own deliberate policy. Sikkim and Bhutan:  two gems of history, monastic culture and religious life.

ZwcnQ0d667I,Peru Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Peru.
Lima is the capital of Peru, the second largest country in South America after Brazil and Argentina.The Palacio De Gobierno is also known as Pizzarro, or Government Palace. This Neo-Classic building was completed in 1938 and stands on the foundation of the former Pizzarro Palace. In the palace gardens is the house in which Pizzarro was killed. Lima, the City of Kings, became the capital of the largest region in Spanish South America and was where the viceroys of the Spanish crown resided. During colonial times this city was the largest, most populated, finest and most cultivated city on the continent. Some of the most beautiful colonial buildings in South America are to be found in Lima‚Äôs old town along with carved balconies of Moorish origin. Huaraz is the 3,050 metre high capital of the Departamento Ancash in the White Mountain range, the Cordillera Blanca. Several natural catastrophes destroyed the majority of the old houses and many people were killed. In 1824 Simon Bolivar built his headquarters there prior to his bloody struggle for Peru‚Äôs independence. The valley oasis of Nazca which played an important role during the early history of Peru is a desolate area in the south of the country. A small airport is the starting point of a journey to one of the world‚Äôs greatest mysteries, the enigma of Nazca culture: images of humans, animals and geometric forms scattered over an area of 1,000 km¬≤ like the pages of some fantastic historical and astronomical book, created by the Nazca between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D.The 8,300 km¬≤ Lake Titicaca is located at an altitudeof 4,000 m in the Andes Mountains on the border that divides Peru and Bolivia. Then there‚Äôs Machu Picchu, the Lost City Of The Incas! Peru is a country full of mystery and ancient history. A land of mountains, desert and jungle. A precious gem on the edge of the world!

The sea has always been of great importance to the city of Siracusa. Greek colonialists first arrived here by boat and settled in Sicily and thus laid the foundations of the region‚Äôs future prosperity. The attractive historic centre of the old town is located on the island of Ortygia whose buildings contain almost two thousand seven hundred years of history. When under the dictatorship of the tyrant, Dionysios The First, the town had a population of half a million that even surpassed that of Athens. Following a two year siege in 212 B.C. the Romans succeeded in conquering the metropolis. The Teatro Greco is one of the most beautiful amphitheatres of Ancient Greece and at the beginning of the fifth century dramas and comedies were frequently performed there. It once accommodated up to fifteen thousand spectators. Numerous colourful legends abound of the nearby Ear of Dionysios. The grotto is a wonder of acoustics in which even the most gentle whisper can be heard. Legend has it that the tyrant Dionysios used the phenomenon to eavesdrop on his prisoners. Siracusa is a fascinating and atmospheric place, steeped in history, myth and legend.

Take in the many splendors of the nation‚Äôs capital when you arrive at Washington, D.C.

Your Washington, D.C. tour should start at the National Mall, where you‚Äôll find monuments, memorials, and government buildings instead of tons of shopping. If you‚Äôd like to get around town easily but don‚Äôt want to rent a car, the Capital Bikeshare program will let you cruise around the city without wasting gas or getting stuck in traffic.

Check out the Watergate Hotel and Kennedy Center when you stop at Foggy Bottom, then move on to Georgetown, the oldest district in D.C. It‚Äôs filled with 18th-century buildings and, of course, the university itself. After a stop at the National Cathedral, make your way to the Smithsonian National Zoo, the perfect stop for the young and the young at heart.

If you‚Äôre feeling the need to channel your inner 007, go to the International Spy Museum, and learn about the covert operations and intelligence agencies that have shaped the world we live in. Of course, you can‚Äôt enjoy any Washington, D.C., tourism without admiring the White House, so make sure that‚Äôs on your list too.

The Hungarian capital, Budapest, is situated on the banks of the Danube in Central Europe. It‚Äôs the political, economic and cultural heart of the nation, and one of the most beautiful and livable cities on the continent.
  
For a sweeping overview of the city head to the Buda side of the Danube and take in the views from the 19th century ramparts on Gell√©rt Hill. Just upriver is Budapest‚Äôs oldest area, The Castle District, home to Buda Castle, Matthias Church and Fisherman‚Äôs Bastion.
 
Once you‚Äôve explored the heights of Castle Hill, cross the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge to the Pest side of the city and follow the riverbank upstream to Hungary‚Äôs Parliament Building. Nearby, pay your respects at the Shoes on the Danube Memorial, a sobering tribute to the thousands who were executed here during The Second World War.
 
After admiring the magnificent dome of St. Stephen‚Äôs Basilica, allow yourself to be swept up Andrassy Avenue. This world heritage listed boulevard opens out onto Heroes‚Äô Square and City Park.  The park is home to the Sz√©chenyi Thermal Baths, just one of the city‚Äôs many lavish bathhouses. For many in Budapest, ‚Äútaking the waters‚Äù is a weekly ritual.
 
Whether it‚Äôs the sparkling Danube or the thermal springs, there‚Äôs something truly rejuvenating in the water here. So when you‚Äôre ready to experience moments of refection, inspiration, and sublime beauty, come to Budapest, you‚Äôre sure to come away rejuvenated too.",travel

24 Hours in London Travel Guide Video Transcript:

London. Like many world capitals, this is a city that never sleeps, and on my most recent visit, I got to experience that firsthand. My challenge was to discover 24 unique experiences in London ‚Äì one for every hour of the day! 

From secret speakeasies to living room concerts, and whimsical afternoon teas to bustling food markets, I scoured the city to bring you the following 24 hours in London! Let‚Äôs begin. 

I skipped breakfast to visit a coffee shop in Hampstead!

With a bit of caffeine in my system, I continued on to my 9:00 am activity which was walking up Parliament Hill in Hampstead Heath with a great lookout point of the city skyline. 

Set in a former power station it is home to the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present.

I got off at Westminster Station and walked over to Horse Guards Parade for my next activity. 

If you‚Äôre visiting with kids there‚Äôs a section inside the museum where you can try on different uniforms.

Cruising down the Thames is a classic way to experience London while hearing interesting London facts that you won‚Äôt find in any guidebook.

With hundreds of food stalls selling everything.

What can you do in the middle of the afternoon in London? I made my way over to the West End for a show.

Having afternoon tea at the Sanderson was like stumbling down a rabbit hole and being transported to the world of Alice in Wonderland. Everything from the menu to the teapots to the ‚Äòdrink me‚Äô potions was just right!

The RISEGallery has been doing a lot of work to help connect local artists with property owners, and this has resulted in some beautiful murals. 

I attended my first Late where museums and art galleries stay open after hours, offering extended admission or putting on special events.

I got to experience Sofar Sounds, which is a pop-up concert that takes place in people‚Äôs living rooms. It‚Äôs not until 24 hours before the event that you are emailed the address and the names of the artists performing that night. 

Then at 11pm, for a bit of live music, it was onwards to The Blues Kitchen in Brixton, where they do barbecue, bourbon, and blues.

Flight Club is a bar that puts a twist on the traditional English pub by adding modern darts into the equation.

With the clock striking one, my next stop transported me to London in the 1940s. 

This bar was set in an attic and it had a bit of speakeasy vibe. There mixing all sorts of fun cocktails.

We checked out London‚Äôs nightlife scene at 3 am with dance moves at KOKO.

Last but not least, the final activity of my 24 hours in London was breakfast at Duck & Waffle. Located on a 40th floor, this restaurant has amazing views of Central London and they are open 24 hours a day. 

And that‚Äôs a wrap for my 24 hours in London! I hope you enjoyed following along and that also got a few ideas for your own trip. As you can see, this city has plenty to offer, no matter the time of day. Wishing you happy travels and see you next time!

Ecuador is one of the most diverse countries in the world though it's comparably tiny. Beside the Galapagos Islands (which is the #1 tourist destination in Ecuador) the country has a lot more to offer, therefore I focussed on ""La Sierra"" in this video which is a paradise for landscape lovers and outdoor adventurers.

Another reason to visit the Andean region is that you have the chance to dive into the local culture and get a real feeling of Ecuador. The places to see in Ecuador I focussed on in this short video are the result of my own travels along the center from north to south and are easily doable in 2 weeks time.

Things to do in Ecuador covered in this video:
01) 00:36 - Otavalo market in Otavalo
02) 01:00 - Hike the Cuicocha lake
03) 01:25 - Middle of the World, Mitad del Mundo & Quitsato in Cayambe
04) 01:48 - Quito, capital & UNESCO World Heritage
05) 02:08 - Termas de Papallacta (hot springs)
06) 02:24 - Cayambe Coca National Park
07) 02:45 - Quilotoa & Shalala viewpoint
08) 03:13 - Tren Crucero & Nariz del Diablo (Devil's nose)
09) 03:47 - Inka ruins in Ingapirca
10) 04:04 - Cuenca & it's beautiful old town

What are your best things to do in Ecuador?
I‚Äôm looking forward to more tips from other travelers and Ecuador experts. Have you been and know of some cool places? Let us know in the comments below!

lF8byCyRJ2g,London (United Kingdom) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 12800 Hotels in London - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2DFsetA

Travel video about destination London in England.
London is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.

The City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.

After the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.

The Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.

Since the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.

The highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.

The former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.

P_q3BdrFsLI,Singapore Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Singapore.d180027.Destination-Travel-Guides

Small and heavily populated, Singapore is an easy place to explore; nothing in the city is more than an hour from the business district. Thanks to modern construction and outstanding architecture, Singapore is rapidly becoming a powerhouse trade city, but it maintains ties to its Asian roots through traditional temples and many cultural hotspots, like Little India and Kampong Glam. 

Your Singapore tour must include the Botanical Gardens and Orchid Gardens, both beautiful and notable places to visit. If you‚Äôre a fan of exotic animals, stop by the Singapore Zoo and check in with its 300-plus species that take up residence there. You can also take a ‚Äúbumboat‚Äù from Changi Beach to Pulau Ubin, set away from the bustling city, and delight in its quiet mangroves. 

No Singapore sightseeing is complete without a visit to Marina Bay, a glowing, high-tech vision of the future, or Orchard Road, which boasts enough shopping to keep you occupied for several rainy afternoons.

qfUE8xQ_SgE,Los Angeles Travel Tips: 13 Things to Know Before You Go to LA,"Things you need to know before you travel to Los Angeles California.  LA is HUGE. You won't be able to see all of LA, unless you're staying for a very very long time. Los Angeles doesn't have a ""center"" and Downtown LA is not very exciting. LA is comprised of multiple cities Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Malibu. Get a rental car - You'll need it to see most tourist attractions in Los Angeles.
2.  Traffic
 - LA has traffic everywhere, all the time.  All day, every day.  Yes, even at 1am on a weekend.  Deal with it.
 - The freeways have names -- it's not I-405 -- it's ""THE 405""
3. Public Transit
 - LA has a subway!
 - But it probably doesn't go where you want!  Especially the beach!
4. Parking
 - Is often Valet
 - and Costs money everywhere
 - Except when you're parking on the freeway :)
 - Pay attention to street signs (confusing times and days)
5. Navigation
 - Know where you're going and take the correct exit
 - Take the wrong exit and you might end up in some place really sketchy
 - Lots of little cities, the street numbering changes in different cities
6. Weather
 - LA is not always sunny and warm
 - It gets cold -- particularly at night
 - Shorts in the day, but pants and a jacket at night
 - And the ocean water is cold too... 70 degrees is as warm as it gets
 - Inland can be 30 degrees warmer than the beach
 - Lots of sunscreen
 - Sunglasses
 - It's dry -- moisturizer
7. LA is unlike the rest of California
 - It can feel like a different country, or at least a different state
 - Venice Beach in particular
8. Hollywood is in the neighborhood called ""Hollywood""
 - West Hollywood is in front of the Hollywood sign (and a different city) with Fancy homes
 - East Hollywood doesn't have much
 - North Hollywood over the mountain is a suburb of LA
 - Oh by the way -- no actors in Hollywood
 - And if you go see a 30 minute sitcom taping it will take 4+ hours
9. The Valley
 - Means San Fernando Valley
 - Burbank, Studio City, North Hollywood, Van Nuys
10. LA's most well known attractions are also some of the most rundown
 - Hollywood Boulevard or is Tijuana?
 - Venice Beach, oh my lord
11. LA is casual
 - Flip flops and shorts are OK except in the most dressy establishments
12. Bring your own shopping bag
 - Supermarkets charge 10 cents for shopping bags in California
13. Mexican Food in LA is awesome
 - Get some fish tacos!
 - And visit King Taco!

PVEeScXdSVU,Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. 
As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

poe2cLKw9ko,Montreal Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Welcome to Montreal, Canada. This extraordinary city, which began life as a French colony in the 1600s, is now a stunning metropolis combining old-world architecture with modern dashes.

When Mark Twain visited Montreal in the 19th century, he was so taken by its many churches that he nicknamed it ‚ÄúThe City of 100 Bell Towers.‚Äù These numerous buildings are often part of Montreal sightseeing; marvel at the imposing stone fa√ßade of Christ Church Cathedral, or stand beneath the great arched ceiling of the beautiful Notre Dame Basilica. You can spend days exploring the city‚Äôs many sacred spaces, but Montreal tourism is so much more than that; if you‚Äôre a foodie, you‚Äôre in luck, because the residents of Montreal adore a good meal, whether it‚Äôs poutine from a streetside bistro or fresh produce from the farmers market. 

A tour of Montreal will take you across cobblestone streets and through architecture that dates back to the 1600s, but one thing you must remember to do is to walk and play in its numerous green spaces. The city‚Äôs inhabitants take great pride in Montreal‚Äôs natural beauty, and hikes up Mont Royal or along the St. Lawrence River are frequent activities for locals. Remember to bring your camera, as the riverfront and the mountain are full of striking photo opportunities. 
 
What is your favorite part of Montreal?

pnN2BNrSrXY,Moscow Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Your trip to Moscow, Russia is bound to be a special one. From the multicolored spires of St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral to the sturdy red walls of the Kremlin, there is much to see and do in this stunning city.

Named after the Moskva River‚Äîwhich flows through the city‚ÄîMoscow has long been at the forefront of the creative world. Tour Moscow to follow in the footsteps of Tolstoy and Chekhov, among others, and join in the sense of pride Russia feels for its literary tradition. Moscow has named a number of its parks and open spaces after its poets and authors, so take a break at the fountain in Pushkin Square, or rest beneath the leafy trees in Gorky Park. When you‚Äôve gotten your fill of literary splendor, head to the Memorial Museum of Cosmonauts, where you can learn about the Soviet Union‚Äôs efforts to reach the stars and the epic space race that lasted from 1955 to 1972.

Moscow is a city of creativity and innovation, but is also very much aware of its own history; as such, a haunting part of any Moscow sightseeing is a visit to the Fallen Monument Park. After the fall of the Soviet Union, countless statues and monuments were removed from their pedestals and moved to this park. Over the years, more modern artwork and sculptures have been added, turning the park into a strange, yet peaceful graveyard of former icons.

What is your favorite part of Moscow?

Vb7NGZQEdTI,Nepal Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Nepal.
At the foot of the huge peaks of the Himalayas is Pokhara and it is from here that we begin our journey through Nepal. In the past, Pokhara was an important trading link between India and Tibet but the trading of salt and wool came to an end after Tibet closed its doors to the outside world.Kathmandu is a melting pot of both race and religion, a metropolis in the heart of the Kingdom of Nepal, a country of snow-covered mountains inhabited by the gods. Kumari Chowk is the residence of the living goddess, Kumari, who is duly selected from childhood. She is not allowed to leave until puberty as her task is it affirm the king his power. Traditional ceremonies are celebrated throughout the year such as the Festival Of The Children that is a symbol of fertility and sexual purity. Patan is Nepal‚Äôs second largest city and has retained much of its original character due to its three hundred monasteries and temples. It is also one of the oldest settlements in Kathmandu Valley and during the 15th century was the capital of one of three kingdoms. Bhaktapur is the third ancient regal city of the thirty kilometre long Kathmandu Valley that has always been a prosperous trading route between China, Tibet and India. Through the golden gate of Sundhoka is the old royal palace complex. The Torana above the gate is richly gilded and features the ten-armed goddess, Taleju, and her loyal guards. Located on a 1,400 metre high hill, Swayanbunath is a Buddhist monastery complex and one of the most interesting sights in Nepal. The country‚Äôs oldest stupa dates back to the 5th century and is entered from an easterly direction up a staircase that contains three hundred and sixty-five steps. Endless rows of prayer mills and religious images are the instruments of the people‚Äôs deep faith. Hidden in a canyon and located on top of a mountain creek, Dakshinkali stands guard over the valley. This wonderful place is dedicated to the bloody goddess, Kali. The customs of the people in the ‚ÄòKingdom On The Roof Of The World‚Äô may seem somewhat strange. But this land of jungle and eternal snow has developed according to its own rich traditions and beliefs. Like magic!

Leave the regular world behind when you step into the fog-swathed ‚ÄúCity by the Bay.‚Äù From shopping adventures in Union Square to a trip on the city‚Äôs legendary cable cars, a trip to San Francisco is bound to leave you with incredible memories.

Stop by Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf and indulge in its shops and galleries, as well as some of the best fresh seafood you‚Äôll ever taste. Walk on the Golden Gate Bridge and take in the fresh sea air and views of the bay and Pacific Ocean. If it‚Äôs a more serene environment you‚Äôre after, pass through the stately architecture and flowing lagoon of the Palace of Fine Arts. 

Of course, San Francisco sightseeing isn‚Äôt complete without an excursion to Alcatraz, the island prison that once held some of the country‚Äôs most notorious criminals. Look into its empty cells and thick stone walls and wonder, could you escape ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù?

Visit our San Francisco travel guide to plan your Bay Area trip.

Transcript:

Welcome to Lisbon!

Lisbon is Portugal's unassumingly cool capital and western Europe's oldest city that serves over 12 million tourists every year. Way back in 1755 the city was hit by a huge earthquake that destroyed 85% of¬†buildings. The city had no choice but to rebuild itself and the 18th century architecture that reshaped Lisbon is still very dominant today. In fact if you come here, don‚Äôt be surprised to spend most of your time looking up and admiring it as you wander through the fairy tale cobbled streets lined with iconic Portuguese tiles that have inspired artists for generations. Each building and street really does have its own personality.¬†What‚Äôs more, amongst this wealth of history, is an eclectic city renowned for having colourful nightlife, tonnes of culture, music and a cosmopolitan food scene that modestly boasts the best custard tarts on the planet! This city break is ideal all year round, with temperatures rarely going below 10 degrees celsius in the winter and averaging 25 in the summer. It really does seem like Lisbon has it all, and we're here to show you why‚Ä¶

Coming up we‚Äôre going to take you through our top tips for 48 hours in Lisbon. From transport, things to do, places to see, lingo, and where to buy the best custard tarts in the city. We‚Äôve done the research to save you time and help you have the most amazing trip. So let‚Äôs start with how to get here.

The flight from London Gatwick takes just over 2 and a half hours straight into Lisbon‚Äôs only airport which is conveniently just 7km from the heart of the city. 

The best thing about Lisbon Airport is it‚Äôs only a 20 minute drive into the city centre. The easiest way to get in is to jump in a taxi or take the Aerobus. There are two lines running into the main hotel areas that cost ‚Ç¨4 per person each way. 

Alternatively you could take the metro that runs from 6am to 1am everyday or there‚Äôs always the city bus but do expect for both these options to take a little longer. 

Lisbon is known as the city of seven hills so to save your legs from all that climbing you‚Äôll probably gonna want to use public transport at some point. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to get around the city - from train, tram, metro, bus and even funicular lift.

The metro is good choice if you‚Äôre traveling long distances but doesn‚Äôt cover all areas of the city. It‚Äôs one of cleanest metros in Europe, and most stations are open from 6am to 1am every day. 

Trams cover areas of the city where there is no access to the metro. There are two types of trams, the yellow ‚ÄúRemodelado‚Äù trams that route round the old narrow streets and then there‚Äôs modern ‚ÄúArticulado‚Äù trams that operate along the flat sections of the city connecting central Lisbon to the Belem district.

Lisbon has hundreds of buses and 88 different routes so you‚Äôre bound to find one to take you where you need to go. 

The funicular lifts are used to help locals and tourists climb all those hills. The most famous lift is the Santa Justa Lift linking lower and upper Lisbon. Yes, it‚Äôs technically a means of public transport ¬†but it also doubles up a a major tourist attraction and has great a view point at the top. 

We noticed a lot of tourists jumping in Tuk Tuks, and so we thought we‚Äôd give it a go. But it turns out the cobbled streets of Lisbon don‚Äôt make for a comfy ride in a Tuk Tuk, and if I‚Äôm honest a 5 minute ride was a bit of a rip off at ‚Ç¨15.

Working out the best way to pay for transport in Lisbon can get confusing‚Ä¶ so here‚Äôs our simple breakdown‚Ä¶",travel
uJUlOLQShiw,Egypt Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Egypt.
Egypt is a land of monumental temples, gigantic pyramids, the River Nile and the mysterious Sphinx: 5000 years of history.Founded by Alexander The Great in 332 B.C., the city of Alexandria is located in the Nile Delta and it was here that Caesar and Mark Anthony fell under Cleopatra‚Äôs spell. Cairo is Africa‚Äôs largest city and the heart of the Arab world, extreme poverty living next to opulent wealth, and modern, Western boutiques next to ancient souks. The Cairo Museum is home to the most extensive collection of Egyptian antiquities, including the golden mask and tomb of Tutankamun. Towering above almost any other human achievement are the impressive three pyramids of Gisa. The Cheops Pyramid, the world‚Äôs largest single construction, took four hundred thousand workers twenty years to build. It weighs as much as all the cathedrals in Europe put together and spans an area of 53,000 square metres - the height of a fifty storey skyscraper. In the middle of today‚Äôs modern city of Luxor, known as the ‚ÄòCapital City Of The Pharaohs‚Äô, the Luxor Temple stretches along the eastern banks of the Nile and, not far away, the temple complex of Karnak and the Amun Temple. 67 kilometres from Luxor, on the western bank of the Nile, lies the Temple Of Dendera, the most important place of worship for the love goddess, HATHOR, whose heavenly appearance was portrayed by the body of a cow. At Aswan, the landscape of the Nile is enchanting, but it is the stone temples of Abu Simbel that take one back to ancient Egypt, land of the Pharaohs, and archaeological paradise.

LlZ_xDx2Zl0,How To Travel Around London and Buy an Oyster Card - Important Tips!,"Here are some very important tips on how to travel around London and buy an oyster card. 
Especially if  it is your first time visiting London, if you aren't careful you can end up paying a lot more for your travel so it's important you pay the right fare. You can use your oyster card or contactless payment card for lots of different types of transport on London TFL services. This includes buses, trains, tubes, Thames Clipper boats, trams and even the Emirates Airline cable cars. 
My favourite thing to do is to travel on the old Number 15 routemaster buses. A real icon of London. I'll show you all the tips and tricks on how to behave like a true Londoner and not to be barged out of the way by the locals when travelling on transport in London. 
There are other ways to pay for London Transport including Apple Pay on your iphone or with a contactless credit or debit card. But I think it's easiest to get an oyster card when you first arrive. Try to avoid buying paper tickets because they cost more!! And the buses don't accept money so you must have an oyster or credit card or apple pay.

ndxssbwwGZU,SCARIEST Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On,"Roads and bridges are things that are used to travel more efficiently from place to place. They certainly help when it comes to crossing water or great heights between mountains, although those same traits also make these passages absolutely terrifying. These are the Scariest Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend going to any of them. Just trust us.

#8 - Zhangjiajie Glass Walk Bridge
Just a year ago, China opened a breathtaking glass skywalk that had been added to Hunan‚Äôs mountainous landscapes. The winding bridge is 1,410 feet long and, as you can see from these frightening photos, it hovers 984 feet above the ground. This would be the very last place in the world you would find us. You‚Äôre on your own if you want to go check this scary bridge out. 

#7 - Lake Pontchartrain Causeway
You might be able to guess why the bridge in this picture made it into this video just by looking at it. It‚Äôs not particularly high, and it actually only sits 16 feet above the water. The bridge connects the two Louisiana towns of Metairie and Mandeville. It stretches an incredible 24 miles across the lake. If that wasn‚Äôt scary enough, once you get about eight miles into the bridge, you no longer have a visual of land. 

#6 - Captain William Moore Bridge 
Although the bridge in this photo isn‚Äôt all that scary to look at, once you find out about the surroundings and the structural integrity of this bridge, you might just change your mind. This bridge is located in Alaska and it crosses over an ACTIVE earthquake fault. The engineers who designed the bridge planned for the potential disaster and only anchored one end of the bridge securely. Now, when the ground trembles and shifts, the bridge won‚Äôt just be torn apart. However, we want to know how it‚Äôs still safe with only one end secured. How does that work?


#5 - Millau Viaduct, France
The bridge in this picture gives us the same thrilling fear as riding a roller coaster. The bridge pictured here is the Millau Viaduct located in France. The tallest part of the bridge, from the valley floor to tip of the mast is 1,125 feet tall, which is taller than the Eiffel Tower! It may be less than two miles in length, but this is another path we just aren‚Äôt going to bother taking. 

#4 - The Confederation Bridge 
This bridge located in Canada made it into this video not because it is incredibly tall and you‚Äôre scared of heights, but because it is a long eight miles to the other side. You can see just how long it is in this picture. While that in itself doesn‚Äôt seem to shiver worthy, the fact that it is the longest bridge crossing over ice cold water in the world, does. Yes, there are ones that are miles longer, but supposedly not over such freezing waters. This one billion dollar bridge probably won‚Äôt just dump you in the water as it crumbles, but that fear factor that it will is still alive and well. 


#3 - Hussaini Hanging Bridge
Hanging bridge is right! Though it should really be called ‚Äúhanging by a thread bridge,‚Äù just look at the mess in this picture, someone come collect their granny, she needs help! This rickety cable and wood bridge is located in Pakistan, and you couldn‚Äôt pay us enough to cross it. The bridge crosses over the rapidly flowing Hunza River and the tattered and worn remains of the previous bridges hang right next to the one being currently used. To make this bridge that much more unbearable, it was swallowed up by flood waters in 2010. Although there has been a newer one built, it doesn't seem any safer. 


#2 - Monkey Bridges
If you told us that we would have to walk across the scary skinny bridge pictured here, we would have laughed into next week. There‚Äôs just no way. Even though this bridge seems like a joke in a movie, these ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù bridges are used as a quick passage in several parts of Vietnam. The name ‚ÄúMonkey‚Äù bridge comes from the stooped posture you have to adopt when crossing. Just so you know how crazy this bridge is, it is exactly as it looks in the picture; the bridge is made from a single bamboo log with one or two handrails. If you think crossing this is a good idea, best of luck to you and we‚Äôll see you down at the bottom of the river, since you‚Äôre certainly falling in. 


#1 - Eshima Ohashi Bridge
This terrifying bridge wasn‚Äôt a nightmare constructed by an architect but if you looked at this picture of the bridge, you would think it was. This mile long bridge spans across Lake Nakaumi and links the city of Matsue to the city of Sakaiminato. The reason for the sudden climb in the bridge is meant to allow entire barges or ships underneath without incident. Although this bridge looks absolutely terrifying at about a 45-degree angle, it is actually not that steep, and a side view of the bridge shows that the highest point is reached with a gradual incline. It‚Äôs not at all how it appears.",travel
Ca2i3JDmRAM,Avengers Endgame Is NOT A Time Travel Movie,"Avengers 4 Endgame is believed to be a time travel movie. What if I told you that isn't the case at all? Many suspected this after seeing set photos leak. However, after doing some research, I want to propose the theory that Avengers 4 Endgame is NOT actually about time travel in the normal sense as we believe. Instead, there have been some interesting connections that the Russo Brothers have been building up between tony stark and Thanos ever since Captain America Civil War. Check out this unique theory to find out what Avengers Endgame may actually be about and the ""REAL"" solution to defeating thanos.

20 Things to do in Krak√≥w, Poland Travel Guide video transcript:

We kicked off this trip to Poland with a visit to Krakow, a city people have been telling us to visit for years and now we know why. Krakow in the summertime was wonderful! We spent our time enjoying castle views from the river side, exploring neighbourhoods covered in street art, eating some of the best pierogie of our lives, and also discovering what we think may be the best ice cream. The following is our travel guide to some of the best things to do in Krakow!

Wawel Castle is Krakow's crowning jewel, and for centuries it was the residence of the kings of Poland. You can see a mix of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque architecture all in one place. 

While in the city, we also had to walk the Royal Route, which was once the historic coronation path of Polish kings.

After visiting the basilica, we spent a bit of time walking the Main Square, which just so happens to be Europe's largest medieval town square.

And that‚Äôs it for our visit to Krakow! We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city. If you have any other places to add to this list or any tips for fellow travellers visiting Krakow feel free to share those.

This is part of our Travel in Poland video series showcasing Polish food, Polish culture, Polish cuisine while visiting Krak√≥w Polska.

zhtg9XgVwuM,Edinburgh Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The Scottish capital of Edinburgh is one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Its Old Town and Royal Mile are filled with the ghosts of medieval merchants, body snatchers, and poets, while its Georgian-styled New Town shines with the glories of the Scottish Enlightenment.  

To see Edinburgh in all her glory, climb to Arthur‚Äôs Seat, the highest of the city‚Äôs seven peaks. Some historians believe this was the site of King Arthur‚Äôs legendary castle Camelot.
 
Nearby, on another volcanic crag, rises Edinburgh Castle, the very symbol of Scotland itself. Over the last eleven centuries, this castle has been laid siege to 26 times but still it stands, a testimony to the indomitable spirit of the Scots.
 
Edinburgh has long held a special place in the hearts of the monarchy. Her Majesty‚Äôs Yacht Britannia sailed over one million miles before being permanently moored at Ocean Terminal as a symbol of the Royal Family‚Äôs affection for the people of Edinburgh.  
 
Edinburgh has been the jewel in the crown of royals for centuries and its old-world chivalry continues today. Thistle Chapel, in St Giles‚Äô Cathedral, honors the Knights and Ladies of Scotland‚Äôs oldest order.
 
In Princes Street Gardens, rises the world‚Äôs largest monument to a writer, dedicated to Sir Walter Scott. At the Writers Museum, learn about more of Scotland‚Äôs cherished literary adventurers. Edinburgh casts her spell over contemporary writers too, JK Rowling wrote two of her Harry Potter series in cozy Old Town nooks, such as the Elephant House Caf√©.
 
For centuries, the University of Edinburgh has given us intellectual giants such as Charles Darwin, David Hume and Alexander Bell. Explore centuries of innovation at the Scottish Museum, or head to South Queensferry to see the Forth Bridge, an engineering marvel when it opened in 1890.

The Royal Botanic Gardens is one of the world‚Äôs oldest and most important centers of botanical science, yet it‚Äôs still a place which invites one to slow down.
 
Edinburgh is a city that has given the world countless gifts, but perhaps her greatest is showing that all parts of the human experience - the sciences and the arts, the past and the present, the sacred and the light-hearted - all have equal value.

From there, explore the great outdoors at Woodland Park Zoo, full of recreated savannahs and tropical rainforests.

s2CyfAdTNMs,9 Travel Outfit Ideas (Wear This Not That),"Today I will share 9 travel outfit ideas for the airplane.  I am going to show you a piece of clothing and say, ""Wear this not that."" I will help you know what to wear and what not to wear when you travel.  How you dress in an airplane will help you be more comfortable in your outfit.  You will worry less about stains, you will be at ease when you are sitting and bending over, and you will not be self conscious about what you are wearing. Since we are an airline family, I have come up with 9 travel outfit pieces that will help you know to wear this and not that on the airplane.
The number 1 travel outfit idea is to wear one with a Cardigan Not a Poncho - Cardigans add dimension to your travel outfit, they add layering if you get cold, they add length to your body, cardigans can mix and match with your travel outfits while on vacation, cardigans with pockets give you added function in an airport, like a place to store your phone when you have to pay for a coffee. Cardigans can be light weight or heavy for warmth.  Let me know if you agree with all nine #traveloutfit ideas.

o_TKIM1vUEs,Manchester Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Manchester is a city of firsts. It was the epicenter of the Industrial Revolution, the place where mankind first split the atom, and the birthplace of the modern computer.
 
The many chapters of Manchester‚Äôs story come together in Castlefield. Here you‚Äôll find the remains of a Roman fort, Bridgewater Canal, and some of the mills which once generated incredible wealth for the city. In the background, Beetham Tower is a symbol of a city again on the rise.
 
Manchester‚Äôs crowning glory is its Town Hall, built to rival the great buildings of London. During the Industrial Revolution, Manchester‚Äôs merchants went on a spending spree, scouring the world in search of cultural treasures to fill their stately homes. Many of these treasures now reside in the Manchester Art Gallery and the Manchester Museum.
 
In 1653, the Chetham Library became the country‚Äôs first free public library and has been open to all ever since. Two hundred and fifty years later, one of the city‚Äôs greatest philanthropists, Enriqueta Rylands, unveiled the John Rylands Library, dedicated to the memory of her textile magnate husband.
 
Housed in a restored Edwardian pump house is The People‚Äôs History Museum, which celebrates those who challenged Britain‚Äôs rigid political and class systems. At the world‚Äôs oldest surviving railway station, you‚Äôll find The Museum of Science and Industry, while the Imperial War Museum North reminds us of the human cost of warfare.
 
Explore the city‚Äôs musical heritage in the Northern Quarter, and check out Canal Street, which perfectly encapsulates the Mancunian ideals of tolerance and good times. Learn more about the city‚Äôs footballing history at the National Football Museum, or time your visit for a match at Old Trafford.

Our visit Lisbon travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts, entertainment, museums, nightlife and restaurants. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Lisbon city guide.

20 things to do in Lisbon, Portugal | Top Attractions Travel Guide:

Our first stop of the day was Sao Jorge Castle, which is an old Moorish fortification that sits on a hill overlooking Lisbon and the Tagus River. You can get some nice panoramic views of the city from here, and they also have peacocks roaming the grounds.

Miradouro das Portas do Sol is one of the many look out points in Lisbon that offers postcard-perfect views of the city. This particular terrace overlooks the Alfama district and it is always popular with tourists.

Carmo is a mediaeval convent that was ruined during the 1755 earthquake, and today it is used as an archaeological museum.  It's a strange feeling walking down the ruined nave of the church and seeing blue skies above your head, but that's exactly what makes it worth a visit. 

Another place to visit is Belem Tower. The tower was built on the banks of the Tagus River, and it was meant to act as both a defense system and a ceremonial gateway into Lisbon.

The Jeronimos Monastery is one of the most visited sights in Lisbon. It's one of the best examples of Late Gothic Manueline architecture, so have a close look at the intricate detailing when you visit. 

A fun way to get around Lisbon's hilly streets is by riding the trams. There are different lines across the city, but #28 is the most popular one with visitors.

The Santa Justa lift is an elevator that connects the lower streets of Baixa with Carmo Square, and it is the only remaining vertical elevator in Lisbon. Though it is meant to serve a functional role, it is also quite popular with visitors who find the elevator a novel idea. 

And that's a wrap for our week in the Portuguese capital! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you some ideas of things to do in Lisbon. As always, if you have any other suggestion for travellers of places to visit and things to do around town, feel free to share them in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels!

This is part of our Travel in Portugal series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Portuguese culture, Portuguese arts, Portuguese foods, Portuguese religion, Portuguese cuisine and Portuguese people.

xycecbwpIzE,Travelling With a Physical Disability in Japan,"Part 2: Living in Japan with a Physical Disability https://youtu.be/xycecbwpIzE

Many people are aware that Japan has excellent public transportation. If you're a keen observer, you may have noticed the many wheelchair accessible facilities, but perhaps have not seen physically disabled people make use of them. In this video, Yuriko Oda (Wheelchair Walker) and Josh Grisdale (Accessible Japan) show what it's like to travel with a physical disability in Japan's trains, buses, cars, taxis, and planes. 

This is part of new series of social documentaries about Japan that I'm making. Future episodes will attempt to answer questions like: what are the living conditions of the homeless, what does social housing look life and how affordable is housing, what is it like to work in Japan and is there any work/life balance, and what is it like to go to primary school?

If you'd like to support these types of social documentaries, I now have a Patreon account https://www.patreon.com/lifewhereimfrom. Any support at all will be greatly appreciated!

Both Yuriko and Josh post great information about accessibility in Japan, and you can find them at:

Time travel is a staple of science fiction stories, but is it actually possible?  It turns out nature does allow a way of bending time, an exciting possibility suggested by Albert Einstein when he discovered special relativity over one hundred years ago. Colin Stuart imagines where (or, when) this fascinating phenomenon, time dilation, may one day take us.

So we just had a fantastic ride on the gondola with Monolo, who‚Äôs there, he‚Äôs a gondalia here in Venice. 
Then we‚Äôre off to go get our luggage, do some more to camera stuff and then head off so I think it‚Äôs nearly time to leave Venice!

Ok so that‚Äôs it for Venice. next stop is Florence!",travel
F2sepCUnENg,Buenos Aires Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Buenos-Aires.d178242.Destination-Travel-Guides

Named for good sailing winds, Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina, and home to nearly a quarter of the country‚Äôs two million residents. Come for the stunning European architecture, and stay for delicious cuts of meat, the city‚Äôs zest for soccer, and, of course, the tango. 

‚ÄúThe Paris of South America‚Äù boasts outstanding shopping and a friendly populace. A tour of Buenos Aires should cut through La Boca Harbor, where you‚Äôll find numerous street vendors, restaurants, and street dancers willing to give you a spin. Wander down the streets to take in colorful artwork, and make a game out of asking the locals what neighborhood you should tour next. Here‚Äôs a hint: with so much to see, everyone will give you a different answer!

Some will tell you to visit San Telmo for souvenirs, patio shopping, and crumbling historical buildings. Others will suggest Puerto Madero, a refurbished shipping port that boasts a mixture of old-world glamour and modern buildings. What everyone will suggest, however, is a stop by Plaza de Mayo. There you can take in the rosy architecture of the Casa Rosada, which was made famous by Argentine First Lady Eva Peron and the musical about her life, ‚ÄúEvita.‚Äù Take a tour and learn about her life, from her humble beginnings to her rise to power.

Cap off your Buenos Aires sightseeing with an evening walk through Puerto Madero, where you can get a late dinner and dance until the next day arrives.

What do you want to see in Buenos Aires?

6VetCXbYmT4,Why we love travel,"http://www.responsibletravel.com
Here are some things you should know about Responsible Travel: 

We want our customers to have a truly memorable holiday, and we want local communities and wildlife to benefit too. However, our mission has always been bigger than that. We want to make tourism a more caring industry, one that improves places rather than ruins them. We do this in three ways: 

- Try to lead by example with the best practices in responsible tourism.
- Prove the win: win (better holiday for you, better for local places and people) of responsible tourism.
- Target bad practice in our industry with activism and campaigns.

You‚Äôll find honest, genuine holiday reviews on our site from travellers who‚Äôve experienced the trips we offer. As we‚Äôre independent of the specialist holiday companies who run the trips, we rely on our customers‚Äô uncensored feedback to tell us if the trip lived up to its description. Over 90% of our 100,000 customers have rated their holiday 4 or 5 out of 5. https://www.responsibletravel.com/copy/read-real-holiday-reviews-from-real-travellers

We're an activist travel company and we try to raise awareness of controversial and important issues‚Äì we are not afraid to campaign and question the tourism industry in a bid to create change for the better. https://www.responsibletravel.com/copy/activism

Morocco is a North African country that has a coastline on both the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It has borders with Western Sahara to the south, Algeria to the east and the Spanish North African territories of Ceuta and Melilla on the Mediterranean coast in the north. It is just across the Strait of Gibraltar from Gibraltar. 

See in Morocco
==================
At just a few hours from the main European cities, Morocco has everything to overwhelm you with the amazing colors, smells and sounds of Islamic Africa. Imagine bustling souqs and spice markets, stunning mosques, white-washed sea side towns and medieval city centres. With panoramic views varying from snow-covered peaks in the High Atlas to the endless sand dunes of the Sahara, no-one ever has to be bored in this beautiful country.

Movie-famous Casablanca might be the most famous of Moroccan cities and is home to the huge Hassan II mosque, the second largest mosque in the world with only the Grand Mosque of Mecca surpassing it. Many travellers quickly leave this vibrant and modernist metropolis on a search for a more traditional Moroccan experience, but admiring the impressive colonial architecture, Hispano-Moorish and art-deco outlook of the city centre is actually time well spent. Marrakesh, known as the ""Red City"" and probably the most prominent former imperial capital, will leave you with memories to cherish for life. Spend your days wandering through the lively souqs, admiring the old gates and defensive walls, see the Saadian Tombs, the remnants of the El Badi Palace and visit the Koutoubia Mosque with its 12th century minaret. However, when evening falls make sure to head back to Jamaa el-Fnaa, the largest square in Africa, as it fills up with steam-producing food stalls. Indulge in the bustling activity there, listen to Arabic story tellers, watch magicians and Chleuh dancers. Fez, once Morocco's capital, is another gorgeous imperial city. Get lost in its lovely labyrinth of narrow Medieval streets, enjoy its huge medina, see the beautiful city gates, the ancient University of Al-Karaouine and the Bou Inania Madrasa. Also, make sure to visit a traditional leather tanning factory. The city of Meknes is often called the ""Versailles of Morocco"" for its beauty. Its lovely Spanish-Moorish style centre is surrounded by tall city walls with impressive gates and you'll be able to see the 17th century blend of European and Islamic cultures even today.

For a more laid-back experience of city life, catch a sea breeze at Asilah or lovely Essaouira. The blue-washed town of Chefchaouen is an old time travellers' favourite and a great starting point to explore the impressive High Atlas Mountains. Climb Jebel Toubkal, the highest peak in North-Africa, passing lovely adobe villages and exploring the gorgeous Ourika and Amizmiz valleys on the way. The stunning panoramic view from the top will make it worth every bit of your effort to get there. Other praised hiking routes lead through the beautiful Ameln Valley in the Anti-Atlas and the wooded Rif Mountains in the very north.

Hop on a camel back for a trip through the golden Sahara sand dunes at Erg Chebbi, near Merzouga. Spend the night in a desert tent, under the incredibly starred sky. The Sahara is also accessible near the town of Zagora; it's easier to get to from Marrakech but doesn't have the imposing dunes of Erg Chebbi. Somewhat less easy to reach but therefor also less crowded are the dunes of Erg Chigaga near M'hamid. On your way to the desert, make sure not to miss the stunning Todra gorge near Tinghir. The ancient fortified city of A√Øt-Benhaddou is another must-see sight. Although rainstorms damage the mud-brick kasbahs time and again, this mostly abandoned village remains an impressive sight and has been the decor for a range of movies, including Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator.

Do in Morocco
================
Hammams
========
There are two types of Hammam (steam baths) across Morocco. 

The first is the tourist hammam, where you can go and be pampered and scrubbed by an experienced staff member. As these are promoted only to tourists they are the more expensive option with pricing usually around DH 150 for a hammam. They can not be technically referred to as a proper hammam, but they are nonetheless enjoyable, especially for the timid. Your hotel can recommend a good one.

The second option is to visit a ""popular"" Hammam. Popular hammams are the places where the locals go. Ask the staff at your hotel where they would go.",travel

In this week's video we drive through the great state of Indiana.
In the morning, we leave our campsite at the Louisville Metro KOA and begin driving north. The idea is to reach Elkhart, the RV Capital of the World by sundown.

As part of our journey we go through the Indiana capital, the great city of Indianapolis. Although we don't get to explore much, we do drive through downtown, see the Capitol building, which in Indiana is called the Statehouse, and the also famous Soldiers and Sailors Monument which is an obelisk in a very centric traffic circle, which honors the veterans of the Civil War. As we leave the city we also see the Scottish  Right Cathedral, one of the largest masonic buildings in the world. Did I mention it belongs to the Freemasons?

As we continue north we also drive through Kokomo. Remember the Beach Boy's song? ""In the Florida Keys there's a place called Kokomo"". Well it turns out the real Kokomo is here in Central Indiana, and it doesn't display any of the tropical innuendo depicted in the 1980's hit song. There are a bunch of automotive plants, which is surprising because I was under the impression we didn't manufacture anything anymore.

We continue and eventually reach Elkhart. The reason we are here, besides it being a pretty town, is because on the next day we pan to visit the RV/MH Hall of Fame. It is an RV museum, and in their collection the have some of the first houses on wheels, going back to the beginnings of the automobile invention.

uln5qqJTqm0,"Netherlands Summary Travel Video ‚Äì Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, Delft, Rotterdam, Haarlem, Holland","Taking you on a grand journey through the Netherlands, starting with a visit to Haarlem, travelling then down to Leiden, spending three nights in Leiden, doing a few day trips out from there. Then I‚Äôll take you to Delft for three more nights and excursions out from Delft such as to The Hague  which is the political capital of the nation.
http://tourvideos.com/
And then on to Rotterdam the great modern city of the Netherlands, continuing to Utrecht, a university town with a very large historic center and then down to Maastricht in the southern part of the country.  I'll also be going up to the Alkmaar cheese market which is a lot of fun. It happens once a week and it‚Äôs a big touristic event. They re-create what it was like in the old days with the cheese market and the guys running around carrying her sleds full of giant Gouda cheeses, but here in the Netherlands they don't say Gouda, it's 'Howda.' I'll take you to that town of Gouda as well and show you where they make the cheese. 
And then up to Amsterdam for the grand finale.
I‚Äôm staying two nights or three nights in place, in Amsterdam six nights, so I‚Äôll be providing quite thorough coverage showing you the shopping streets and the museums, the old historic neighborhoods, the old brick buildings and going on some canal boat rides as well ‚Äì  that‚Äôs one of the real fun things to do when you‚Äôre in the Netherlands.
In each of the towns I‚Äôll be walking because these towns are compact and historic and have so many things to see while walking around.  And occasionally you can hop on a tram or hop on a bus and that helps you get along. Maybe you want to rent a bicycle. Everybody here is on bicycles.
The Netherlands is a land of canals and bicycles and beautifully and preserved old towns such as Delft and Leiden seem like the architecture hasn‚Äôt changed in the last 300 years.
And it‚Äôs really quite a revelation to see how modern everything is at the same time 
The people of course are highly educated. They have some of the top universities in the world in the Netherlands, and the higher education is all but free for those who are interested.
And it‚Äôs just a nation of friendly people, smart people, very productive people as well. Fortunately for us, just about all of them speak very good English, so it‚Äôs very easy to get by when you are visiting here.
I‚Äôll be spending three weeks traveling by train, and the Netherlands has got perhaps the best  train system in Europe. Yes maybe even better Switzerland. It‚Äôs phenomenal. The trains are clean, fast, frequent.
The foods are great. You can have a reasonable lunch for about ‚Ç¨12, say the equivalent of no more than $15 ‚Äì often it‚Äôs a good hearty sandwich and a cappuccino or a beer. Of course the Dutch love their beer.
And they also drink a lot of wine as well. They don‚Äôt produce wine, but being in Europe, in the center of Europe, it is very easy for them to bring in wines from not just France and Italy and Spain but all over the world actually. You see always a good variety on menus, but especially it's the beer. 
They must have dozens of varieties of beer that are brewed right here in the Netherlands.
Now people also call this country Holland and that‚Äôs a common mistake actually because Holland is just part of the Netherlands. It's two provinces on the Western side but the country actually the Netherlands. And  the people are Dutch,  they speak Dutch. It‚Äôs a unique language. It‚Äôs a separate language but has similarities to German and to Danish.
I‚Äôm traveling in the in the month of September which is a good time to be here, and I got real lucky with the weather so far, it has been perfect. It‚Äôs been let‚Äôs say 75¬∞F 20¬∞ 22¬∞C, just very comfortable and actually a bit warmer that should be at this time of year and that‚Äôs a good thing, sometimes you get lucky.
So it‚Äôs a real excursion through the Netherlands, not just visiting Amsterdam.
Even if you are only going to Amsterdam you should spend 4 to 5 days there so you can do some day trips because the country is pretty small and you can travel all way to the Hague for example by train in about 45 minutes from Amsterdam, so it could be a home base for you.
Traveling for three weeks in this wonderful country was a great experience, including all the way down to Maastricht at the southern tip of the Netherlands, and a little side trip over to Aachen in Germany to see the Cathedral dating back to the year 800. 
You're going to love this upcoming series of movies about the Netherlands. 
We will focus on Amsterdam, of course. I spent a week in this wonderful city. We will have pictures of the museums, the restaurants, the canals, the streets, the old buildings, Rembrandt's house ‚Äì and yes it took a lot of walking to get these shots. It was three weeks on foot.
The Netherlands presents the visitor with the wonderful variety of sights to see. You're going to love this upcoming series of movies about the Netherlands.",travel

Xfp-W1HDW2M,TRAVEL ON A BUDGET | How we travel so often?! | TOP Travel Tips,"Some of the most beautiful sights don't cost a dime to see and even when they do I've figured out how to save my family hundreds $$ of dollars. This video features my top 13 tips and tricks to saving money and getting more time on your trip for the same price! Have travel hacks of your own? Comment them below and tell me your dream destination!


ADDITIONAL TIPS:

‚òÜ Request early check-in and late check-out at your hotel
‚òÜ Leave the liquids at home! Hotels will ALWAYS give you extra shampoo, soap etc. if you ask
‚òÜ Most car insurances will cover your rental car for FREE - check your policy to avoid paying for unnecessary coverage
‚òÜ Don't forget many car rental agencies add a fee per day for drivers under age 25 - but it varies from company to company so do your research
‚òÜ Forgot your phone charger? Don't buy a new one, ask the front desk to borrow one of their MANY extras

MILITARY SPECIFIC TIPS: (Thank you for your service!)

‚òÜ Always select ""Government Rate"" when booking hotels (EVERY hotel we have ever stayed at has offered one)
‚òÜ Checked baggage is almost always FREE with your military ID (we save a lot this way and still get to pack extras)
‚òÜ Ask for military discounts everywhere you go- you'd be surprised how many places give you 10% or more off purchases
‚òÜ Disney World offers military pricing as well as a military only resort for both veterans and their families called Shades of Green (which does not appear on the Disney Booking website)

xsSnOQynTHs,Dan Abramov - Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel at react-europe 2015,"React‚Äôs unique strength is bringing to JavaScript development some of the benefits previously exclusive to more radically functional languages such as Elm and ClojureScript, without forcing you to completely eschew local state or rewrite code with exclusively immutable data structures.

ieWNzZPfZzk,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro.d178301.Destination-Travel-Guides

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city‚Äôs iconic peak, and try not to look down ‚Äì it‚Äôs a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

The ‚ÄúCidade Maravilhosa,‚Äù or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

Visit our Rio de Janeiro travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

Was a very interesting and fun experience testing it out in real life travel situations :D
The one I used here was English to Japanese, however there are many other languages so check out their website for more information!

Many of you ask me if it's okay to travel to Japan even though you speak no Japanese and the simple answer is YES! With basic English and gestures you can get around Japan, however for those of you still worried about the language barrier than try out ili when you're travelling next time :)

My itinerary for this video:

Asakusa, Tokyo
- Kimono rental @Vasara
- Asakusa street food along and around Nakamise Street
- Asakusa temple @Sens≈çji, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple
- Back streets of Asakusa @Hoppy Street
- Asakusa rickshaw ride

uAUfF8UVAdI,How to Use the Tokyo Subway | JAPAN TRAVEL GUIDE,"In this video, I show you everything you need to know in order to use the Tokyo Metro System effectively. It can be complex and intimidating if it's your first time in Tokyo, so hopefully this video will simplify it for you, from buying tickets to finding your destination. Don't be scared of Tokyo Subway! It's probably one of the world's most efficient transportation systems, and can get you anywhere! This is the first video of my Japan Guide series, so stay tuned for more tips and tricks for traveling/moving to Tokyo, Japan!

I have people asking how to calculate their fare for a specific trip, you can use Google Maps which tells you the single ticket fare, so you will pay 5-10Yen less if you are using an IC card. You can also use Tokyo Metro's calculator which tells you all different fares but only available for Tokyo Metro lines (so excluding TOEI/JR lines): http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/search/index.php

Day Pass Prices (prices as of the day this video was upload
Tokyo-Metro-Only 24h Pass - 600 Yen
Tokyo Metro & Toei 1-day Pass - 1000 Yen
Everything 1-day Pass - 1590 Yen
TOURIST-ONLY Tokyo Metro & Toei Passes - 800 Yen for 24h, 1200 Yen for 48h & 1500 Yen for 72h (available for purchase at Haneda & Narita Airports, select BIC CAMERA stores, travel agencies, etc. More about this pass: https://goo.gl/HWJLps)

TIPS FOR SAVING $$$
1. Stick to Tokyo Metro lines only - these 9 lines should get you to all touristic destinations (some may require slightly longer transit time, but it won't be much longer than the more expensive route)
2. Avoid buses if you are just traveling - they are expensive and doesn't provide free transfer to metro
3. Buy a combo pass if you arrive from Narita or Haneda Airport, they can save you a lot of money. More info: https://goo.gl/YxiVpo
4. Group together sights that can only be accessed by subway within the time period limited by the 24h/48h/72h metro pass. Go to sights that are accessible by foot on other days

Lyrics:

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

I'm traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who
Forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light' like we used to do

But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to do
I'm traveling light

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

5J6mUK2bbaQ,Paris (France) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 3.913 Hotels in Paris - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2SLwWQk

Travel video about destination Paris in France.
Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. First established by the Celts, next used strategically by the Romans, then it served the extravagant lifestyle of the Sun King, Louis XIV until it became a hotbed of Revolution.

Champs-√âlys√©e is surely one of the most beautiful avenues in the world. It has wide boulevards, shady corners, ambient street cafes and classic Parisian buildings that are decorated with flowers.

Since 1873, the Palais de l'√âlys√©e has been the residence of the French President. At the beginning of the 17th century, Madame de Pompadour lived there and during the Revolution the liberated people cavorted in its luxurious rooms.

Through a small triumphal arch decorated with scenes of Napoleon's victorious army, there is the garden created by Leotre, the Jardin des Tuileries. A bridge and fountain are the focal points of this popular park, created in typical French style.

A modern glass pyramid and a fountain decorate the courtyard of the former Louvre Palace, which since the time of the Revolution has been transformed into a museum that contains the famous Louvre art gallery. Its collection of remarkable historic treasures and superb art collection make it one of the world's most famous museums with Leonardo Da Vinci¬¥s masterpiece, the Mona Lisa, taking pride of place.

Situated on a small island on the River Seine is the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the 'Mother Church of the Nation'. Built on the foundations of a Roman temple and commissioned by the bishops Maurice and Eudes de Sully, it took almost 200 years to build this Gothic masterpiece.

Built at the end of the 19th century as a symbol of national revival, Montmartre's Sacre Coeur has the appearance of a white, fairy-tale palace with 237 steps that lead up to the main entrance of this extraordinary structure. Its Byzantine architecture and five cupolas are reminiscent of the Marcus Dome in Venice.

Of course, there are the dizzy heights of the Eiffel Tower and a great deal more. Paris is a wonderful festival of the senses!

Bon Matin! 

It‚Äôs our first morning in lovely Paris, and we‚Äôve just had breakfast. I had an omelette, and it was really really delicious.

We are now on our way to Notre Dame, but lots to see and do, very excited, and I‚Äôll keep you posted throughout the day!

See ya later!!

Hello, me again! Some back stage exclusives, just been interviewing a guy called Tibaut, at the restaurant we ate at last night. Just got some questions around this kinda food, and what makes France and particularly Paris food so amazing. 
Really good, we‚Äôre actually going to break for lunch ourselves now, so stay tuned and I‚Äôll keep you posted a bit later on!

Bye!

So we‚Äôve just done some various shots along the Champs-Elys√©es, and Arc De Triomphe. Now on a bridge on our way to the Louvre, a very lovely bridge actually, that‚Äôs what I like about France everything is so opulent, even their lampposts are really swish! Check this out‚Ä¶ 
And yeah! On our way to the Louvre. 

See ya later!!

Ok, so I‚Äôm now on the bank of the River Seine, just did a quick French tutorial with a couple of guys from Discover Walks. They‚Äôre a company based here in France. They do really really good tour guides, Tom walked me from the Louvre, through the gardens... I can‚Äôt pronounce it! Jardin de Tuileries?!
Basically means, and roughly translated to, tile gardens because there used to be a tile factory there.

Learnt some insider tips about the Louvre: don‚Äôt go to the tourist entrance because that‚Äôs for chumps, apparently! Go like the locals and use one of the many other ones that are lying around!

The weather is glorious! So I'm gunna walk to the Eiffel Tower! See ya soon!",travel

KoH2bU9xADg,"The people, history and culture of Uzbekistan - Traveling the Silk Road | DW Documentary","With its magical buildings, fascinating landscapes and friendly people, Uzbekistan has a lot to offer. It is a country caught between rich traditions and modernity.

Wild equestrian games, fairytale palaces and hospitable people proud of their magnificent culture - all this will be encountered by those traveling through Uzbekistan on the Silk Road. The central Asian country borders Kazakhstan to the north and Afghanistan to the south. The journey begins in Samarkand, one of central Asia‚Äôs oldest cities.

For centuries cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva provided the necessary infrastructure for the caravans on the Silk Road, allowing merchants to trade their goods and providing accommodation for them and their animals. Many buildings still survive to underline the splendor and wealth that trade once generated. In Samarkand, one of the world‚Äôs oldest cities, three outstanding Koran schools, known as madrasas, on Registan Square have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Boysun region in the Hissar Mountains the ancient, and none-too-gentle riding game known as Kopkari is held at Nowruz, the New Year festival. More than a hundred horsemen try to pick up the body of a dead goat from the ground and to escape with this from all the others. In 1380 the Uzbek folk hero Amir Timur (Tamerlane) had the gigantic Ak Sarav, the White Palace, built in Shahrisabz, the town of his birth. It had a thousand rooms adorned with gemstones.

I explored my DNA with 23andMe! Learn more about your genetics through 23andMe and get 30% off your order.

Science fiction has introduced us all to the idea of traveling into the past ‚Äì but is it really possible?

Sean Carroll talks bout how time travel would possibly work in the context of Einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity, including the hypothetical idea of wormholes connecting distant regions of space. Dr. Carroll also explores the logical structure of time travel, and what it implies about predestination and free will. In the end, time travel is probably not possible, but by taking the idea seriously we help understand how the universe works.

pwymX2LxnQs,Travel Deep Inside a Leaf - Annotated Version | California Academy of Sciences,"Please turn on subtitles with the CC (Closed Captions) button to see the explanatory annotations designed for educators.

Transcript of closed captions:

0:05: We are approaching a redwood tree. To animate a scientifically accurate leaf, artists studied the texture of a redwood leaf specimen on a glass slide at high resolution. They even counted the stomata, and used that exact count for this film!

0:25: These leaves would be measured on a centimeter scale. Throughout the animation, we will gradually zoom in to smaller scales.

0:40: As we approach a single stoma, we are now on a millimeter scale.

0:48: As we enter the interior of the leaf, we see many individual palisade cells.  These cells are where photosynthesis takes place; they are translucent to allow sunlight to enter.  

1:00: As we approach a single palisade cell, we‚Äôll zoom down to the micrometer scale.  The shapes inside the cell are organelles: the bright globules at the bottom are the Golgi apparatus; the yellow spotted tubes are endoplasmic reticulum studded with ribosomes.  

1:09: That large, blue membrane surrounds the nucleus; the purple blobs are mitochondria.

1:18: The faint, yellow, spider-web structure of the cytoskeleton provides structure and support to the cell.

1:24:  You are about to enter a chloroplast; inside you see flat, pancake-like membranous structures called thylakoids.  This is where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place to produce ATP, the cell‚Äôs energy carrier molecule. way


1:38:  The time scale has changed:  the molecules are shown moving 1 million times slower than in real life!

1:42: As we near an individual thylakoid, the animation scale continues to shrink down to the molecular level, where things are measured in nanometers.


1:52: The green and blue bush-like structures are photosystems: clusters of proteins that absorb light energy from the sun and help convert it into the chemical energy that‚Äôs stored in the bonds of the energy carrier molecule called ATP.

2:03: The yellow-green, rotating structure is an enzyme called ATP synthase.  It pumps protons from one side of the thylakoid membrane to the other, assembling ATP molecules in the process.  

2:16: The pulses of light in the thylakoid membrane in which the photosystems are embedded represent energized electrons being passed from one photosystem to another, passing along the energy which will be stored in the bonds of ATP (the classic ‚Äúbucket brigade‚Äù).

2:26: The small ‚Äúwigglies‚Äù are ATP molecules.  Living things store energy in the bonds of the ATP molecules and then use that energy to conduct all the processes of life.  

This animation is a model, and has its strengths and limitations. In order to model something well, visual artists have to make decisions about what to represent and how best to do so. What‚Äôs present in this model, and what‚Äôs intentionally missing or altered? Find out by visiting https://www.calacademy.org/educators/travel-deep-inside-a-leaf

The California Academy of Sciences is a renowned scientific and educational institution dedicated to exploring, explaining, and sustaining life on Earth. Based in San Francisco‚Äôs Golden Gate Park, it's the only place in the world to house an aquarium, planetarium, rainforest, and natural history museum‚Äîplus cutting-edge research programs‚Äîall under one living roof.

Pear-Shaped Atom Points To A Cosmic Mystery
https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2016/06/27/pear-shaped-atom-points
‚ÄúAn atom is comprised of dense nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a diffuse cloud of electrons. Since an atomic nucleus is held together by the strong force, similar to the way gravity holds stars and planets together, you would think nuclei would be basically spherical. This isn't always the case, and a few such as barium-144 are even pear shaped. ‚Äù

https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-discover-brand-new-nucleus-shape-time

Boston is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Massachusetts, officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. One of the oldest cities in the United States, Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan colonists from England. 
The most important places to visit in Boston are: Boston Common (starting point for Freedom Trail, dating back to 1634, this central public park is loved by locals as well as visitors), Massachusetts State Building (given its gold dome, the state capital can not be missed. It is the seat of the Massachusetts government), Faneuil Hall (constructed in 1742, it has been an important meeting hall. Today there's a market that offers many places to eat and shop), Beacon Hill (a famous historical neighborhood of Boston, amidst its well preserved streets, you will feel like you've gone back in time), Granary (part of the Freedom Trail, it was built in 1660. The site is the resting place for many prominent personalities and statesmen), Trinity Church (said to be one of the greatest buildings in the country, for a special treat, attend a concert during Christmas season), Harvard University (considered to be the world's greatest academic institution, you can tour its campus to soak in the wonderful ambiance), Copley Square (many important buildings with diverse architecture styles are here. This is also the site of the Boston Marathon's finish line) and many more. 
If you want to save time and money, the most important Boston travel tip is to compare prices before booking a hotel room or a flight. You can do this for free on http://bookinghunter.com, a site that searches through hundreds of other travel websites in real time for the best travel deals available.",travel

Here's an ode to the beautiful state of Nagaland as we discover a little something about the culture, the tribes, the upcoming fashion designers, the pop culture and the FOOD (very important) of the North East Indian state of Nagaland! 

Accompanying me on this journey is Larissa Dsa, who has an impeccable style and spirit of adventure, and hence we will together discover the fashion and food secrets of Nagaland. Besides a perfect co-traveller, she is also a brilliant YouTuber and Photographer herself. You absolutely can't miss her work! :)

A second perfect addition to this trip is Namrata Menon, a very talented videographer/cinematographer. She and her work for me were and instant love and I can't recommend her enough for more video projects. Not only is she a talented girl, but also super fun to travel with. 

Our trio survived a 15 day worth of madness and exciting travel adventure and I cannot wait to share the whole series with you. The web series releases on 15th June, and is very different from my other travel series thus far. Stay tuned and hope this Trailer excites you!

JTuYlU4KB00,"Mussoorie Hill Station, Uttarakhand || India Travel Videos || ‡§Æ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§π‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§∂‡§®","Mussoorie ( mansuri ) is a hill station and a municipal board in the Dehradun District of the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand.
It is about 35 kilometers (22 mi) from the state capital of Dehradun and 290 km (180 mi) north of the national capital of New Delhi. The hill station is in the 

foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan range. The adjoining town of Landour, which includes a military cantonment, is considered part of 'greater Mussoorie', as are the 

townships of Barlowganj and Jharipani. 

Mussoorie is at an average altitude of 1,880 meters (6,170 ft). To the northeast are the Himalayan snow ranges, and to the south, the Doon Valley and Shiwalik ranges. 

The second highest point is the original Lal Tibba in Landour, with a height of over 2,275 meters (7,464 ft). Mussoorie is popularly known as The Queen of the Hills.
Mussoorie was founded by Lt. Frederick Young of East India Company. Lt. Young came to these hills for the purpose of shooting game.

He was so enamored by the beauty that he decided to build a hunting lodge (shooting box) on the Camel's Back Road with FJ Shore, Jt. Magistrate of Doon in 1823. He 

raised the first Gurkha Regiment and planted the first potatoes in the valley. His tenure in Mussoorie ended in 1844 and he further served in Dimapur and Darjeeling 

and retired as a General and went back to Ireland.[citation needed] There are no memorials to commemorate Young in Mussoorie. However, there is a Young Road in 

Dehradoon on which ONGC's Tel Bhawan stands.

In 1832 Mussoorie was the intended terminus of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India that began at the southern tip of India. Although unsuccessful, the Surveyor 

General of India at the time, George Everest wanted to have the new office of the Survey of India based in Mussoorie. A compromise was to have it in Dehradun, where it 

still is.

Mussoorie view from the top of the hill (can be viewed while traveling on the way towards down of the hill), Another view from the top of a Hill
The name Mussoorie is often attributed to a derivation of 'Mansoor', a shrub which is indigenous to the area. The town is often referred to as 'Mansoori' by most 

Indians.

t40hlvzEvwY,Can SpaceX Make Point-To-Point Space Travel Profitable?,"SpaceX and Blue Origin think point-to-point space travel will replace flights as the preferred means of passenger travel. A plane ride from New York City to Shanghai is about 15 hours - and it could be as long as 29 hours with connecting flights. With point-to-point travel, SpaceX says it could get you there in less than an hour. How realistic is this approach to long-haul travel?

As companies like Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin close in on offering trips to the edge of space, space tourism is becoming a possibility. But what if spaceships went farther ‚Äî and faster?

Point-to-point space travel has been touted as a business line by SpaceX, Elon Musk‚Äôs rocket and spacecraft company.

AD8vRDaJWPs,NAGALAND - DZUKOU VALLEY &amp; JAKHAMA  | Travelling in North-East India | Indian Travel vlogs,"Welcome To Nagaland! (3/3) DZUKOU VALLEY & JAKHAMA - The villages in Nagaland.

I visited Nagaland in the month of April and had the opportunity to open my mind to endless experiences! For the longest time, Nagaland and the whole of North East has been so neglected: tourism wise and also culturally :(. So I took the plunge to discover the beautiful state myself, with two other creators- Tanya Khanijow & Namrata Menon. These girls have been the most lovely to travel with :)
This is Part 2 of the Nagaland series #TakeMeToNagaland! there are 3 in total! please watch part 1 because it's super fun and features the cities - Dimapur & Kohima ( the capital of Nagaland)


üôèüôèThings to remember when you plan your travel:üôèüôè

üôèThe Visvema route (the one I took) is much easier compared to the Jakhama route. 

üôèYou can camp  the previous night at Campsite Yedika just like I did, before you trek to the valley.

üôèDrones are not allowed in the valley (we had special permissions to use them)

üôèYou can get in touch with @tirelessfoot_nicholas on Instagram, incase you're interested to trek to the valley. He's a good buddy, and will help you in the best way

üôèEntry to the valley is INR 20/- only

üôèCarry your sleeping bags and down jackets cuz it's super windy and extremely cold at night. I went in the month of April and it was super cold.

üôèThe best option would be to trek early in the morning and reach the dormitory by or before 2pm. 

üôèDO NOT trek to Dzukou without a local guide.


üôèYou need an ILP-(Inner Line Permit) to enter the state of Nagaland. You can apply here‚Äî  https://www.india.gov.in/application-... 

üôèCommute in the city is pretty straightforward. You can use the local rickshaws, or hire a car to go around. The roads are super bumpy especially in Dimapur & Kohima, so be prepared :D

üôèThe food scene is very much different than mainland. Vegetarians options are available, but make sure you mention you‚Äôre vegetarian since they also tend to cook their veggies in pork fat. Nagaland thrives on pork and beef, and a lot of things you don‚Äôt see in the rest of the country. I suggest that you visit with an open mind, else it will be super difficult to survive. I personally loved the food. :D

üôèMake sure you have enough cash on you. It‚Äôs advisable to carry cash from home since it was even hard to find ATMs. 

üôèHomestays are the best way to experience the local living. Since the people are super friendly, the hosts are lovely to interact with and know so many things about the Naga culture.

üôèDo a lot of research before you visit. The state has 16 different tribes and they speak different dialects. Read about their lifestyle and food. 

üôèCarry your rainwear and warm clothes since the weather is pretty unpredictable. The best time to travel according to me is December (for Hornbill festival ) and also April. 

üôèNagaland is a dry state! :P 

üôèNagaland is a state full of beauty and the nicest people I've ever come across. The misconceptions about this magic land are hilarious! So do not believe anything else you hear about this place. We stayed here for 10 days and had no issues, problems at all! Trust me! Your next travel, must be planned for the north-east especially NAGALANDDD! 


üíãAlso, thanks to Tanya and Namrata, for helping me film so many shots! 

This video, and the rest of the videos of the Nagaland series are in collaboration with Tanya Khanijow! and also in collaboration with the super talented cinematographer - Namrata Menon :* Love you my mungi :*

R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,"Many people daydream about traveling the world, but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling ‚Äì hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book ‚Äú1000 Days of Spring‚Äù and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: http://tomislavperko.com/en/.

The locals in Fiji have a saying, ‚ÄúBulla,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúgood health.‚Äù You‚Äôll hear it used frequently as a greeting when you arrive at the 330-strong islands that comprise this archipelago. You may even find yourself saying it before long!

Any Fiji tour will highlight its magnificent, unspoiled waters and lush landscapes. Go snorkeling, swimming, diving, and sailing on turquoise waters. If you‚Äôd rather stay on dry land, you can zipline through rainforests or explore the windy plains of the highland area. Travel to the interior and learn about traditional Fijian culture, or visit the capital city of Suva and wander through its colonial buildings, bazaars, and the quiet harbor. 

Two-thirds of the Fijian archipelago are uninhabited, and your Fiji sightseeing should include a stop at Denarau‚Äôs marina, where you can book a boat to take you to some of these pristine locations. From family-friendly islands to romantic getaways, you‚Äôll find something to your taste amongst these scattered isles.

Do you have a favorite memory of Fiji? Share it below!

N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/caribbean/cuba.d44

It‚Äôs only 93 miles from Florida, and just 13 from the Bahamas, but like the smoke that coils from its legendary cigars, The Republic of Cuba exists in a time and space all its own.
 
Few cities can stir the imagination like Cuba‚Äôs capital, Havana, a city preserved by forts, a five-mile seawall, and an imposed embargo, which held back the excesses of the 20th century for over 50 years.
  
Havana‚Äôs lure can be hard to resist, but Cuba offers so much more beyond the seductive lights of its capital. In Cuba, a long sandy beach is never far away. 
 
Just 12 miles from Havana‚Äôs downtown, the Eastern Beaches unroll toward the town of Matanzas, the birthplace of the rumba, and C√°rdenas, where the Cuban Flag flew for the very first time. From here, follow the scent of fresh lime, rum and suntan lotion north to Varadero. 
 
After exploring the northern coastline, turn south towards Cuba‚Äôs most revolutionary city, Santa Clara, and Trinidad, once the sugar capital of the world. Don‚Äôt miss elegant Cienfuegos, the only Cuban city founded by the French. 
 
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know whether Cuba is awakening to the world, or if the world is awakening to Cuba. Whatever your politics, it's easy to admire this island nation that has proudly gone its own way.
 
Cuba may still have one foot firmly in the past, but as the world tumbles towards tomorrow, we can be thankful for the many things it has not let go.",travel

vzSHcyXfNPw,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

We also paid a visit to the many dentists of Mumbai! Rob broke one of his teeth on the train to Mumbai so we went looking for a reputable dentist in Mumbai. We‚Äôve heard that getting dental work done in India is actually something foreigners pay to do since it is a lot cheaper than a lot of countries and also of very high quality. So really, we are in the best possible place to fix Rob's teeth!

73ulvWgcZKA,Should My Boyfriend and I Travel Alone? // Ask Pastor John,"Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together and stay in the same hotel? Should they? Pastor John gives three reasons why they shouldn‚Äôt.

Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together? Stay in the same hotel? Should they? It‚Äôs a question we get regularly. And this time from a young woman. ‚ÄúHello, Pastor John. My boyfriend and I plan to leave in three weeks for a trip we scheduled five months ago. My mother said she fears for us and for the temptations that could arise during the trip. I have assured her that while we have fallen into temptation in the past, we have desperately sought God and other Christian counsel to confront that pattern, and that we truly have laid it at the foot of the cross. After discussing this respectfully and in full, we concluded that all would be fine.

‚ÄúToday my mother again confronted me and tells me that she believes we are dishonoring God, even though we will be staying in separate rooms the entire week. While I am frustrated, I also do not want to dishonor my parents‚Äô wishes. I‚Äôm troubled in wondering if we are dishonoring God by traveling together before marriage.‚Äù

i9E_Blai8vk,Welcome to Bali | Travel Vlog | Priscilla Lee,"I had the chance to fly out to Bali with my whole family this Thanksgiving for our first ever trip abroad!

SEND ME AN EMAIL (ONLY BUSINESS INQUIRIES): travelvlogiv@gmail.com
PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9h

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ

Q How do you work together with brands?
A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",travel

O9_QA69bz9M,INDIA LUXURY TRAVEL: CONRAD BENGALURU | TRAVEL VLOG IV,"India luxury travel to is truly underexplored. In this vlog I‚Äôm exploring the beautiful luxury hotel called Conrad Bengaluru. The Conrad hotel in Bangalore is one of the most beautiful luxury hotels in the city. For me it has been a dream property to review, ever since the Conrad Bengaluru opened it's doors a little over a year ago.

Especially as a foreigner it‚Äôs good to know India is not just a budget destination. You can find anything here as a foreigner tourist. It‚Äôs such a shame not to explore India luxury travel for a holiday.

I hope this video helps foreigner tourists when traveling India and inspires to include a luxury getaway, next to other adventures. More information on Conrad Bengaluru: https://bit.ly/2M02Gij

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9h

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQ

Q How do you work together with brands?
A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",travel
nPOO1Coe2DI,Dubai Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Dubai-Emirate.d1079.Destination-Travel-Guides

Come to Dubai, the ancient City of Gold, for your next vacation.

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city. Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania¬Æ, a ‚Äúcity‚Äù where children can roleplay various careers.

To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you‚Äôd like to try something a little different and don‚Äôt mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren‚Äôt staying there.

You can‚Äôt finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all. 

Visit our Dubai travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

Avengers: Endgame Timeline

So the movie opens three weeks after Thanos carried out the snap. The universe is devastated but after the surviving Avengers track him down and Thor finally goes for the head we pick up with them five years down the line, in 2023, which is where things start to get a bit confusing.

Due to the discovery of Time Travel, we start off with our heroes all in the same position at the Quantum Tunnel. They have split into groups, all with their own objectives and we initially follow Team A, made up of Captain America, Iron-Man, Ant-Man and Hulk.

This group travels to the Battle of New York to retrieve 3 infinity stones and split off into their own smaller groups. This is set during 2012 and it‚Äôs pretty much the moment that the entire infinity stone saga began with Thanos appearing in the post credits scene of The Avengers to kick everything off. However, things don‚Äôt play out exactly as expected and it‚Äôs at this point that Loki takes the tesseract and travels off to Disney + thus creating an alternate timeline.

Hulk and Ant-Man gain the Time and Mind Stone and together they travel back to 2023, however Tony and Cap still need to secure the tesseract and from here and thus they travel to the 1970s to secure the Tesseract. We will call this group Team AA and Hulk and Ant-man, Team AB. But what happened to the timeline they‚Äôd just left?

Well for now, that‚Äôs royally screwed up for the moment and at this point Thanos would probably still most of the stones, however he wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry out the snap so would probably just go planet to planet murdering people the old fashioned way.

In addition to this the timeline that they‚Äôve just left is slightly altered with the stones missing and though Tony managed to get some stuff off his chest, he‚Äôs still left this timeline very vulnerable.

Team B made up of War Machine, Nebula, Hawkeye and Black Widow then travel to 2014 during the events of Guardians of The Galaxy. This team then splits into Team BA and Team BB with Team BA, made up of War Machine and Nebula securing the power stone from Morag.

Rhodey returns back to the present with the power stone, but Nebula is kidnapped, and replaced with evil Nebula who is carrying out the bidding of Thanos. We will call this team, made up of Thanos‚Äô forces Team BC.

This timeline is really messed up now too. The events of Guardians Of The Galaxy do not happen as Quill is unable to get the Powerstone and the Gamora from this universe travels with Thanos to 2023 to fight the avengers, which I‚Äôll get into later.

On Vormir we join Team BB, Black Widow sacrifices herself in order for Hawkeye to gain the Soul Stone and he travels back to the present.

yORJH5B4z1o,FAMILY of FOUR converts OFF-GRID VAN to travel the WORLD,"Get the Van Conversion Guide: http://bit.ly/GetVanGuide

We met up with Charlotte and Andre and their two children to check out how they made their incredible van conversion! 

Hire this van with Quirky Campers: https://goo.gl/c7TNqm

This van conversion has a few pretty innovative features including TWO double beds, wood burner, fixed sky light and a beautiful rustic design.

This off-grid van conversion has a solar kit to allow for being away from campsites (or to avoid paying to plug in!) and gives them everything they need to travel as a family.

It is so cool to see this adventurous family create a beautiful living space that allows them to chase their dreams of traveling the world together.

Over the past few years I've found myself averaging anywhere from 2-4 flights a month. That's more than the typical American. I am lucky that I get to create my own schedule, and skip off to a new adventure whenever I please- here are the 10 travel mistakes that I've made so that you are aware of them and don't make them. Some of these are rookie travel mistakes that may seem obvious, and some of these are more personal to my perspective on traveling and how to have a fulfilling trip. I hope these help you in your travels!

My Millennial Life Crisis was started 3 years ago when I was stuck in a rut creatively, career wise, and personally. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I wasn't happy with where I was living, and I didn't feel like I had much of a support system. That is how the Millennial Life Crisis series was born. It was a way for me to let go of my feelings and document my personal growth. Along the way I have found that a lot of you have related with this feeling, that is why I keep vlogging. From now on you can expect weekly Millennial Life Crisis episodes about my life, growing up, career growth, trying new things, friendships, relationships, family, and travels.",travel

Qu7NZ1rC1Ow,Liechtenstein (Europe) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Liechtenstein in Europe.
In the middle of the triangular border of Germany, Austria and Switzerland lies a treasure of the European Alps, the Principality of Liechtenstein.  Hardly anywhere else in Central Europe has experienced such a rapid transformation from a dreamy agrarian state into one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Bendern, part of the village of Gamprin, is one of eleven municipalities and lies to the south-west side of the Eschner Mountain.  The view glides across the foothills of the romantic Rhine Valley and up to the massive Swiss Schw√§g-Alp. The Schaedler ceramics workshop in Nendeln is one of the oldest commercial enterprises in Liechtenstein and features handmade works of art.  Since 1836, they have specialised in earthenware, exclusive ceramic art and tilted stoves. Schaan forms the border to the Oberland, a charming municipality with an attractive town centre.  A parish hall and provision of good restaurants reflect the success of the global companies that are located there. Liechtenstein Castle looms majestically above Vaduz, the capital.  Saint Florin is located on the edge of the old town it was built in 1868 in Neo-Gothic style and in 1997 officially dedicated as a cathedral.  From the Sareiser Joch there are several trails along the ridge such as the Princess Gina Route that traverses various mountains of the border triangle.  More than four hundred well marked hiking trails are offered throughout Liechtenstein, plus a hundred and sixty kilometres in the Alps. The Principality is a treasure trove of both landscape and culture with mountains, pastures, castles, fortresses and museums.  But Liechtenstein has also become a small, modern state with a vital and indelible focus on finance and industry, a tiny paradise that is also an important economic power.

iXGtx-hroKE,Working online and traveling the world - digital nomads | DW Documentary,"Working online whilst traveling the world sounds like a dream job for many people. But what exactly is a digital nomad? Pete and Supi live as digital nomads.

They travel the world permanently, work on the road and are always online. Their lives epitomize the digital revolution and how it is changing how we work live.

Many people dream of living and working on the road - a dream that has come true for Pete and Supi. Driven by a passion for travel, they set out to escape the dreary routine of everyday life. They want to achieve maximum self-fulfilment without big safety nets and full-cover insurance, in a nomadic world of adventure. Pete is a DJ, so parties and big cities are a defining part of his life, whereas Suparni aka Supi is the opposite; she‚Äôs looking for spirituality and awareness. The two show us the huge spectrum of opportunities that the world of the digital nomad has to offer. Despite their fundamental differences, they both earn their living by working remotely. The digital age has made this way of life possible: without the Internet, it would be almost unthinkable. But their lifestyle does have its limits, as is becoming especially evident to Suparni with her plans for parenthood. But it's hard to find someone you love who also loves the same sort of lifestyle, and the constant travel is a big obstacle.

6hhaoTNu2a4,Madeira Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Madeira-Island.d11326.Destination-Travel-Guides

Pushed by volcanic forces from the sea floor into the warm trade winds of the North Atlantic, are the dramatic cliffs of Madeira. Volcanic activity may have settled millennia ago, but the island‚Äôs rich soils and spring climate means Madeira explodes in lush vegetation all year round. 

Madeira‚Äôs capital, Funchal, was named after the wild fennel which once carpeted its hillsides. Walk streets paved with patterned stonework that evokes the spirit of Portuguese culture and pride. Explore centuries-old churches and homes, which have endured pirate raids, German U-boat attacks, and earthquakes. 

From Funchal, head west to Cabo Gir√£o, one of the world‚Äôs mightiest cliffs. You‚Äôll find colossal views just a fifteen-minute drive east of Funchal too. At Garajau, watch divers far below enjoying the undersea gardens of the marine reserve. 

Madeira‚Äôs ring road strings together coastal towns and beaches, each one a little different from the last. If you‚Äôre looking for the island‚Äôs sunniest spot, head to Ponta do Sol. If you‚Äôve got a sweet tooth, head to the old sugar town of Arco da Calheta and enjoy a honey cake. And if the rumbling sound of breakers is your idea of relaxation, spend a night or two at Paul do Mar.

Madeira‚Äôs northern coastline offers plenty of drama and adventure too. Feel the power of the Atlantic in the natural swimming pools of Porto Moniz. If you‚Äôre keen on hiking the levadas into the mist-covered interior, the town of Seixal makes an ideal base. 

Less than an hour‚Äôs drive from Funchal is Pico do Arieiro, Madeira‚Äôs third highest peak.
From here, experienced hikers can follow knife-edged trails to even higher peaks, the same peaks that guided Portuguese mariners to Madeira six centuries ago.",travel

MRI8ffYKA8c,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d178316.Destination-Travel-Guides

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

DEJx0CYrDHk,Rome Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"As legend has it, Rome, Italy, was founded by the twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, in 700 B.C. The former Caput Mundi, or Capital of the World, sits beneath Palatine Hill, where the ruins of its original incarnation are open for exploration.

No Rome tour is complete without stopping by the remains of the Temple of Saturn and Arch of Septimus, both located in the Roman Forum. Get in touch with your inner gladiator and stop by the Colosseum, a relic of Roman bloodsports and perhaps the most recognizable element of the city.

Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain to ensure you‚Äôll return to Rome one day; don‚Äôt toss in two coins unless you‚Äôre ready to fall in love with a Roman. Continue your Rome sightseeing in St. Peter‚Äôs Square, home of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica. The world‚Äôs largest church, designed by Michelangelo, is both a remarkable structure and a tribute to faith. You can look down from the famous dome to the Holy Square, which is usually filled with the faithful looking to obtain a blessing from the Pope. After this, it‚Äôs just a few steps to restaurants filled with Italian food. Forget coming back to Rome ‚Äì you‚Äôll never want to leave.

What‚Äôs your favorite memory of Rome?

QSwvg9Rv2EI,Chicago Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Chicago.d178248.Destination-Travel-Guides

Chicago, once a small trading post on Lake Michigan, has grown into one of the country‚Äôs most famous cities. Visit ‚ÄúThe Windy City‚Äù and chow down on deep dish pizza for a truly unique vacation experience.

Follow ‚ÄúThe Loop,‚Äù the city‚Äôs primary business district, and marvel at its array of high-rise buildings, consulates, and universities. Shopping and fine dining abound in this area. If you‚Äôve worn yourself out in the city proper, set a more sedate pace at the Riverwalk, a pedestrian path along the Chicago River, or visit the many museums and parks the city has to offer. You‚Äôll never believe you‚Äôre actually downtown when you walk through the Garfield Park Conservatory, and the Art Institute of Chicago will allow you to appreciate creative works from around the world.

No Chicago tour is complete without a mention of the nightlife, so close out your day at a jazz lounge and let the sweet sound of music carry you away. Visit our Chicago travel guide and plan your next vacation today.

1PGiixdhNVk,Portland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Portland.d178299.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Portland, Oregon, where you can experience the laid-back atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest amid beautiful natural surroundings.

A Portland tour is easily accomplished on foot; this city was designed for pedestrians, so you‚Äôll be able to get around quickly. As you stroll along, you‚Äôll find plenty of parks, fountains, and buildings old and new to explore. Be warned, this city is known for its sudden showers, so make sure you bring an umbrella to shield yourself until the sun makes a triumphant return.

If you like a good brew, you‚Äôre going to love Portland‚Äôs alter-ego, Beervana ‚Äì so named thanks to all the breweries located here. Wine snobs, don‚Äôt despair; you‚Äôll find plenty to drink (responsibly) in the Willamette Valley while you continue your Portland sightseeing. 

If you‚Äôre here with the kids ‚Äì or you just really love animals ‚Äì don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Oregon Zoo, home to eagles, bobcats, and a ton of other feathered, furry, and scaled critters. Travelers with children will also love the Portland Children‚Äôs Museum, where the little ones can learn from and play with interactive exhibits. 

Whether you‚Äôre here for the beautiful views or to responsibly sample the vintages in the valley, Portland has something for everyone. What are you going to do when you get there?

Visit our Portland travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

ka-ZgwCXKho,Venice Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Rising from the waters of Venice Lagoon is the Italian city of Venice, a city like no other.
Begin your visit in the central district of San Marco, and walk upon one of the world‚Äôs great squares, St Mark‚Äôs Square. The square is surrounded by some of the city‚Äôs finest jewels such as St Mark‚Äôs Basilica, St Mark‚Äôs Campanile and Doge‚Äôs Palace. 
 
Just outside stand the Columns of San Marco and San Teodoro. From here, journey along one of the world‚Äôs great aquatic thoroughfares, The Grand Canal. Glide past elegant palazzos; once the homes of wealthy merchants, today many of these palaces house important museums and galleries. 
 
Known as The City Of Bridges, Venice has hundreds to explore. The Accademia Bridge links the San Marco district to the Accademia Gallery, and offers some of the Grand Canal‚Äôs finest views. The oldest of the Grand Canal‚Äôs four crossings is the Rialto Bridge, which today still serves as the gateway to the Rialto Markets. The most famous of all is the Bridge of Sighs, which connects Doge‚Äôs Palace to the historic prison.
 
Venice is a city to get lost in, so put away your map and let her surprise you. Discover waterfront promenades of The Zattere and the sleepy canals and spacious piazzas of Castello. On the tiny island of Murano, glassmakers have been creating works of incredible delicacy and color for over 700 years. Further across the lagoon, the island of Burano is famed for its brightly colored houses and exquisite lace.
 
Venice has shone her light into the far corners of the world for over one and a half thousand years. Just remember, this city smiles upon those who linger. So stay for a few nights, or stay for a month, and savor every moment she has to offer.

Ketchikan is a small town located five hundred and twenty six nautical miles north of Vancouver and was founded by the Tlingit Indians.  In the 1880‚Äôs the town based its economy on salmon and timber but today relies upon tourism. Since 1900, Juneau has been the capital city of Alaska, the forty ninth state of the U.S.A.  In 1880, Joe Juneau, Richard Harris and their Tlingit Indian leader, Chief Kowee, discovered gold in Gold Creek and the gold rush began. Glacier Bay was completely covered by ice and glaciers around four thousand years ago during the Little Ice Age.  The ice melted and the ever-changing glaciers are today situated within the arms of the bay which stretches almost a hundred kilometres to the north. Barrow is the northernmost point of inhabited North America and five hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.  The living conditions in the arctic wastelands are extremely harsh and most of the year it is bone-chillingly cold. Even today the promise of untamed nature and boundless freedom attracts us to America‚Äôs final wilderness.  Alaska is full of wild extremes and stark contrasts, a fascinating land of pure adventure!

tVflvbwKdHU,Cancun Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Cancun.d179995.Destination-Travel-Guides

Surrounded by the warm waters of the Yucatan Peninsula, Cancun is famed for its sunshine, history, and wild nightlife. Come to this former Mexican fishing village turned resort town to join legions of fellow sun worshippers ‚Äì just don‚Äôt forget to pack sunscreen.

Your Cancun tour should stop at the Acuario Interactivo, where you can meet mariachi-singing dolphins and other friendly sealife. Explore the vast historical offerings of Cancun by heading to the Yucatan interior, where you‚Äôll find ancient Mayan cities available to tour. A day trip to Chichen Itza, one of the world‚Äôs Seven Modern Wonders, is another must. Wander through its ancient streets and take in the temples, an observatory, and even a sporting arena.

At sunset, your Cancun sightseeing will come to a dazzling conclusion amid the wild nightlife. Watch shows, go dancing, attend parties, and make sure you‚Äôve got your camera out. It all begins anew the next day; morning in Cancun means more time to make sun-drenched memories that will last a lifetime.

What‚Äôs your first stop in Cancun going to be?

tZg2QOpzh40,SINGAPORE TRAVEL VLOG: Where to go + What to do + How much to spend,"How Singapore‚Äôs lack of natural resources yielded a contemporary city left us in awe! With the lush greeneries to sky-high buildings, this city has a lot to offer that kept us wanting for more.

We decided not to avail of travel packages so we can fully explore every corner of all the attractions without any time constraint. We def recommend a DIY trip if you are photo/video/memory hoarders like us.  From traveling with the locals in their daily commute to learning their culture- all were one for the books!

XhHwGolzQmg,Hawaii&#39;s Big Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Hawaii.d180074.Destination-Travel-Guides

The ‚ÄúBig Island‚Äù of Hawaii is the largest of the Hawaiian Islands, and offers a fascinating and stunning array of beautiful scenery for you to explore.

Sightseeing on Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island means your days will be filled with natural wonders: wander around a lava field, stroll through a tropical rainforest, and take a dip in the warm waters of the Pacific. To get the most out of your Hawaii Big Island tour and to get an idea of what areas you‚Äôd like to see up close, we suggest renting a car and exploring Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island from behind the wheel. The Onomea Bay Scenic Drive, located along the Hamakua Coast, will take you past shimmering emerald rainforest and astonishing glimpses of the tranquil Pacific Ocean. It‚Äôs the perfect place to get some pictures and see what the beauty of Hawaii is really about.

No tour of Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island is complete without meeting the sea turtles of Kahalu‚Äôu Bay. Strap on your mask and snorkel, and swim around the warm, blue-green waters of the bay to get up close and personal with the turtles and thousands of other sea creatures. If hanging out with the sea life isn‚Äôt entirely your cup of tea, you can also try paddleboarding, jet skiing, or a variety of other watersports. Alternatively, you can spoil yourself in the time-honored indulgence of relaxing on the black lava sands, soaking up some of the legendary Hawaiian sunshine.

What will you do on Hawaii‚Äôs Big Island?

When ready, check out vacation packages to Los Cabos: https://www.expedia.com/Los-Cabos.d180032.Destination-Travel-Guides



A tale of two towns on the very edge of Baja California Sur, Los Cabos is synonymous with relaxation and recreation. But when the team at Expedia made the voyage here, they found more than just a beautiful vacation destination.
They uncovered new shores, geological monuments, and exciting experiences. They encountered a region with diverse and welcoming people, vibrant art culture, world-class cuisine, and of course, a thrilling nightlife. 

For a romantic secluded escape, consider the arty San Jose del Cabo, a cultural hub bursting with inspiring art, Spanish colonial architecture and sheltered shores. 

If you are chasing the fiesta, check in to a hotel in Cabo San Lucas. Every sunset brings a new party to the sands and the streets here, so don‚Äôt forget to pack your dancing shoes.

_EkO2ofPOXg,Jordan Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"Want to know what goes into creating one of the Expedia Vacation Travel Guide videos? Check out how we made Jordan here: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/video/jordan-video-behind-the-scenes/

https://www.expedia.com/Jordan.d90.Destination-Travel-Guides

The ancient Greeks knew Jordan‚Äôs capital, Amman, as Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Overlooking Amman is the Citadel, the city‚Äôs ancient core. Rising over the Citadel are the remaining pillars of the Temple of Hercules, a Roman temple that in its day dwarfed many in Ancient Rome.  

 

From Amman, journey north to Jerash, home to one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Italy. Then, continue north to Ajloun Castle, built to halt the Crusader armies as they rode down Jordan‚Äôs northern valley, hell-bent on Jerusalem.

 

Enter the gravel plains of the Eastern Desert and follow the Desert Castle Loop. For many, the highlight here is Qasr al-Azraq, where Lawrence of Arabia made his winter headquarters. 

 

Travel south to Madaba, famed for the Madaba Map, one of the earliest depictions of the Holy Lands. Continue south along the Kings Highway, which once took Arabs to Mecca, and Israelites to the Promised Land. 

 

Follow the hairpin road 1300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea. Float in the saline waters and cover yourself in the same mineral-rich muds Cleopatra once enjoyed. 

 

No visit to Jordan is complete without a visit to Petra. Emerge from the shadows of the Siq and gaze up at the Treasury, the greatest of all of Petra‚Äôs 500 tombs. Then continue south to explore the emptiness of Wadi Rum. 

 

From epic landscapes to monumental ruins, Jordan allows us to reach out and touch the eternal, and be at one with something far greater than ourselves.",travel

Things everyone does on snapchat they don't want to admit!
First, everyone uses filters when they aren't looking their best. Whether you just woke up or are having a bad hair day, snapchat filters will cover it all! Next, we've all looked into getting surgery to look like that snapchat dog right...? oh just me? Just kidding, I really hope no one has done that. Third, we've all redone a ""candid looking"" snapchat because we didn't like the angle, how our hair looked, etc.

0ohZyqgIyQI,India (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 42.161 Hotels in India - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2EaPS2P

Travel video about destination India.
India is a subcontinent with a long history, a land of legend, fantasy and reality.A country that extends from the Himalayas in the north to the semi-desert terrain and tropics of the south. A place of incredible contrasts and fascinating splendour. Delhi is the political and administrative capital of India and a melting pot of both culture and religion. A constantly expanding metropolis built on the site of twelve former cities and centre of power for almost a thousand years. Jama Masjid, the Friday Mosque, is one of ancient Delhi‚Äôs main landmarks that was bequeathed to the city by the mogul king, Shah Jahan and close to the mosque is the bazaar district of Chandni Chowk, a busy commercial area. The white temples of Ranakpur are the sanctuaries of the Jains and are situated in a picturesque valley to the west of the Aravalli Mountains north of Udaipur. At around the same time that Buddhism was introduced to the area, Jainism also arrived, the religion of the country‚Äôs great hero, Mahavira. Rajasthan is the Land Of The Maharajas in all its splendour, a living fairytale beneath the desert sky. Agra was once the imposing metropolis of the mogul monarchy and today the city has lost nothing of its mediaeval atmosphere. Calcutta, or Kolkata, as it has been known since 2001, is the capital of West Bengal and also the second largest city in India. A city of contrasts that could not be more striking. Each morning hundreds of people go to the Howrah Bridge to bathe on the banks of the Hooghly River, a tributary of the sacred River Ganges. In 1853 Bombay had its first railroad and the Indian rail network was soon extended. The Victoria Terminus was built, one of the most impressive train stations in the world. Incredible India, a remarkable country that has always fascinated travellers by the amazing diversity of its people, culture and landscapes.

a4d5CbK0b3A,Vancouver Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vancouver.d178315.Destination-Travel-Guides

Vancouver‚Äôs breezes carry the scents of nature and aromas of all the urban delights you‚Äôd expect from a city regularly voted, ‚Äúthe Worlds most livable‚Äù.
 
The city takes its name from the British navigator who landed here in 1792.  The original settlement was called ‚ÄúGastown‚Äù, in honor of Gassy Jack, who built the city‚Äôs first tavern. Gassy Jack and his makeshift pub may be long gone, but in the historic neighborhood of Gastown, his spirit lingers on.
 
Vancouver‚Äôs early history continues at Waterfront Station, the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway‚Äôs construction brought Chinese workers by the thousands, whose descendants have enriched Vancouver ever since. Experience this interweaving of cultures in Chinatown, where the fusing of Oriental flavors with local seafood has helped earn the city the title, ‚Äúthe Culinary Capital of Canada.‚Äù
 
After visiting Vancouver‚Äôs central highlights, ride the ferry to Granville Island. Stock up on provisions at the Granville Island Public Market and sample craft ales at Granville Island Brewing. From Granville Island, head to Queen Elizabeth Park on Little Mountain, a peaceful oasis high above the city.
 
When it‚Äôs time to answer the call of the wild, cross the Lions Gate Bridge to The North Shore, a wilderness where bears roam and salmon-filled rivers flow through old-growth forests.  Less than a two-hour drive from the city is Whistler Blackcomb Resort, the largest ski resort in North America. The beautifully connected runs here cater to all skill levels and attract elite skiers and beginners from all over the globe.",travel

The film was released on December 22, 1939 by Paramount Pictures, who had the feature produced as an answer to the success of Walt Disney's box-office hit Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The sequences for the film were directed by Seymour Kneitel, Willard Bowsky, Tom Palmer, Grim Natwick, William Henning, Roland Crandall, Thomas Johnson, Robert Leffingwell, Frank Kelling, Winfield Hoskins, and Orestes Calpini.

72__Mdioty8,Hong Kong Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Hong-Kong.d178263.Destination-Travel-Guides

Hong Kong, a former British territory, is one of the most densely populated places in China and in the world. You‚Äôll find quiet neighborhoods full of temples and a dazzling skyline loaded with shopping and dining opportunities.

Your Hong Kong tour must include visits to the many religious sites scattered around the city, where incense wafts from shrines and monasteries take over entire hillsides. You‚Äôll have a marvelous time shopping in tax-free Hong Kong, where you‚Äôll be able to find clothing, jewelry, furniture, and everything else under the sun. 

Don‚Äôt forget about Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, which overlooks the stunning Victoria Harbor. From there, your Hong Kong sightseeing may detour to Central, the city‚Äôs main business district, which looks like something out of a sci-fi film. The observation deck atop the International Commerce Centre will show you fantastic views of the city.

Hong Kong isn‚Äôt all cityscape, of course; there are many gardens, parks, and other green spaces for you to explore. You‚Äôll also find beaches, national parks, and quiet islands for you to indulge in natural beauty and serenity. This city truly has everything.

Visit our Hong Kong travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

rGKf1NhtJ1o,Queenstown Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Queenstown.d180018.Destination-Travel-Guides

Queenstown, in New Zealand‚Äôs South Island, is the gateway to stunning fiords, glaciers, ski fields and vineyards. This lake-side city provides the pulse that keeps this remote corner of the world energetic and youthful. As the descendants of fierce Polynesian warriors and determined European settlers, the Kiwis have the spirit of adventure running though their veins. 

Experience the beauty of Lake Wakatipu aboard the TSS Earnslaw. Nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Lady of the Lake‚Äù, for over 100 years this steamship hasn‚Äôt missed a beat, transporting livestock and passengers to and from the High Country. Back in Queenstown, soak up the Aotearoa sunshine on a sandy beach or in Queenstown Gardens. For a bird‚Äôs-eye view, ride the Skyline gondola to Bob‚Äôs Peak. Then when the sun gets low, head to Marine Parade and enjoy Mother Nature‚Äôs spectacle with kindred spirits from all over the world. 

Queenstown expands and contracts with the rhythm of the seasons. After the hectic summer, the town transforms into a world-class ski destination. Queenstown has three main ski fields; The Remarkables Ski Field, Cardrona Alpine Resort and the Coronet Peak Ski Area.

When the snow melts, Queenstown transforms again to accommodate visitors who flock to the Arrow Basin to explore its charming historic towns. The Kiwis know when it‚Äôs time to slow down, unwind and enjoy the finer things in life. Queenstown and the nearby Gibbston Valley are home to over 75 wineries, where vintners produce pinot noirs acclaimed for their purity, freshness and vitality, a perfect reflection of the region itself!",travel

AlCqyZEXM1I,Travel More &amp; Buy Less. | Luis Vargas | TEDxPortland,"We live in a world of consumption. Before you buy your next item for your ""man cave"" or ""she shed,"" think again. Adventure and exploration is the best way to learn and expand your horizons. The idea here is simple and enlightening, that one should have a passport full of stamps rather than a house full of stuff. Travel more. Buy less. #GO

This is the second relaxing Psychedelic/Space Rock mix I've made. The first one https://youtu.be/iuWa5wh8lG0 was released about a year ago and it got insanely popular, clocking in at 3 million views at the time I'm writing this! 

This mix is pretty much the same but with others tracks and pictures. Some artists makes a well deserved return but there are also new ones in the mix.

You'll find the tracklist, timestamps and links to each artist below in the description and in the first comment under the video. You will also find links to every picture I used in the video in the pinned comment below. Please give the musicians your support if you find anything you like in the video. My last space rock video has really helped a bunch of bands to sell records and it was all thanks to you guys!

5g_7ODyxYQM,Pack with Me! | Packing Cosmetics for Air Travel in a Carry On | This or That,"NOTE: I have TSA Precheck and have never had issues traveling with this bag. If you do not have expedited security clearance, I recommend packing your liquids, gels, and creams in a quart sized clear bag. Most makeup is fine to pack separately just like what is represented in this video. If this is not how you like to pack, that is totally fine! This has worked perfectly fine for me the past 3 years that I've had Precheck. :) 

I recently took a 10 day international vacation to Italy! Join me as I pack my favorite cosmetics travel case that was packed into my AWAY Bigger Carry On suitcase and my small cosmetics bag to keep with me for quick access on the plane. You don't want to be caught unprepared for a long, overnight, international flight! Need some help packing? I got you!

*The one I have a was a collaboration with Sophia Joy and Target and was limited edition. There are a million just like it, though! I highly recommend the ones with a zippered mesh pocket, a covered area for brushes, and a large storage compartment on the bottom. The structure is perfect!

wW2y79D-9vk,Brunei (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 7 Hotels in Brunei - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2DEK6VA

Travel video about destination Brunei.
Brunei Darussalam is a tiny sultanate in the north of the island of Borneo located on the shores of the South China Sea and is surrounded by the Malayan federal states of Sabah and Sarawak. The capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, is like something from an exotic fantasy.

The splendour of the mosque of Sultan Omar Ali Saiffudin is a captivating sight. This Islamic landmark is also a symbol of great wealth and was built in 1958 and was named after the father of the present sultan. Snow white Italian Carrara marble was used as building material, with granite from Shanghai. It commemorates the founder of modern Brunei.

On a classic longboat powered by outboard motor, we travel on the Brunei River and are soon surrounded by mangrove brush. Tropical thunderstorms and monsoon rain create dense vegetation and the ensuing humidity produces lush flora.

At the junction of two muddy-grey waterways of the Brunei River is an historic location, Kampung Ayer, a water village. Each building and adjoining pathway is built on posts yet there is both an electricity and drinking water supply. Plants decorate the terraces, and TV aerials are everywhere and it has a population of around thirty thousand.

Brunei is a land that has almost lost its history while moving into modern times. It is a country that has grown amazingly wealthy since its gas has hissed and its oil has spluttered from deep below the ground. Liquid gold - Allah be praised!

wuwEFQuYOUo,Hong Kong Travel Tips: 11 Things to Know Before You Go,"11 things YOU need to know before you go to Hong Kong. A comprehensive travel guide to bring you up to speed on the Weather, Language, Getting Around, and more! Hong Kong was originally a British Colony founded in 1842, taken over by China in 1997. Hong Kong‚Äôs Official Name is the ‚ÄúSpecial Administrative Region of Hong Kong.‚Äù In Chinese Hong Kong Means ‚ÄúFragrant Harbor.‚Äù Hong Kong is Famous for Skyscrapers (it has 8,000 of them), but 40% of it‚Äôs land is park and nature preserve
Hong Kong has 3 main areas, Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories
But in total it has 263 islands

2 - Weather
Hong Kong's climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius in winter and exceeding 31 degrees Celsius in summer
Pretty humid all year round
May to November is typhoon season
June & August are the wettest
January and December are the dryest

3. Getting In
Likely flying in to Hong Kong International Airport - HKG.
 
It‚Äôs on Lantau Island, and its HUGE!  The size of 20 soccer fields.
 
You can fly to almost anywhere in the world from Hong Kong (more than 100 airlines operate 1,100 daily flights to and from 190 destinations worldwide) 
 
Cathay Pacific is Hong Kong‚Äôs home airline and has won ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Airline‚Äù four times ‚Äì more than any other.

Airport Express train to Central - Its just 24 minutes, and leaves every 10 minutes
You can buy a round trip airport Express and Octopus card for 3 days unlimited MTR for $350

Taxi one way to Hong Kong Island would be about $400 HKD and take 45 mins to an hour

4. Unlucky
This number omitted because it‚Äôs unlucky.  4 in Chinese sounds like the word for ‚ÄúDeath.‚Äù  Most buildings typically omit this floor.


5. Getting Around
By public transit‚Äîit's efficient, clean, and affordable
First things first, buy an Octopus Card -- It works on almost everything, even to get you in to the Hong Kong Horse Racetrack
MTT - Subway
Star Ferry - About $3 HKD, Upper Deck & Weekends cost a bit more.
Tram - Ding Ding - $2.60
Double Decker Bus
Mini Bus
Taxi - Relatively inexpensive, but can be hard to hail during rush hour, or a rainy day, or shift change between 3-4pm.
Don‚Äôt try to hail a cab if you see double yellow lines by the curb. Taxis can only stop if there is a single line‚Äîor none at all.
Uber


6. Money
Hong Kong Dollar
Exchange Rate fixed to the USD.  1 USD = HK$7.75‚Äì7.85
Most places take Visa/Mastercard
40% take AMEX
Lots of ATMS -- Hong Kong is a huge financial center after all
Bills: Issued by 3 different banks, so you‚Äôll see 3 different designs for all the bills
HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000
Coins: 


7. Language
2 Official Languages
1.Chinese, (Spoken Cantonese)
2. English
 
In the major urban districts, most residents will speak English but Cantonese is the local language
 
If you think you‚Äôre planning to learn a little Cantonese before you go‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not easy‚Ä¶ it has nine tones.

8. Shopping

Shops often stay open late‚Ä¶ none of this European 6pm closing time‚Ä¶ think 9 or 10pm closing times for most shops and malls

9. Food:

Cantonese Food
And it‚Äôs all about sharing, portions are big and made for big groups
Dim sum originated here in southern China and means ‚Äútouch the heart‚Äù. These tiny bites of goodness were created as snack food for travellers and today are an essential part of local culture.
Dim Sum
Hong Kong Milk Tea

Dai Pai Dong, Fast Food Noodle Shops, are common sites in Hong Kong offering an inexpensive bowl of noodles for around HK$20 and free tea

 Bones -- yes, lots of the local food has bones it.  At the casual restaurants you can just put the bones on the table.  At a fancier restaurant use the saucer plate beneath your bowl

Tea -- Need a refill for your teapot?  Turn the lid upside down.

Like to avoid the crowds?  Then avoid eating lunch between 1-2pm, that‚Äôs the typical Hong Kong lunch hour

10. Feng Shui
The mystical art of feng shui is still common practice in Hong Kong -- wondering why a building‚Äôs architecture looks weird?  The answer usually has to do with Feng Shui‚Ä¶ that might be why your hotel lobby has a water feature and some goldfish in it too!

11. I‚Äôve got more videos!

OrIDTJH2ZZM,Sydney Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Sydney.d178312.Destination-Travel-Guides

Ready for an adventure? Click play on our travel guide video to uncover some of the best things to do in Syndey, Australia. 

Established in 1788 as a penal colony, Sydney was once a little rough around the edges, but it has since transformed into a must-visit coastal destination. Today, tourists flock to this city on the east coast of Australia for its pristine beaches, coves, and harbors. 

During your romp around the scenic coastline, make a stop at the Syndey Opera House and eye its magnificent architectural design. Looking for a little more adventure? Venture over to the Syndey Harbour Bridge, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Coathanger,‚Äù and brave a bridge climb tour. Next, hop on the antique thrill rides at Luna Park, which is a family-friendly favorite that dates back to 1935, or saunter around Darling Harbour. Meanwhile, if you‚Äôd prefer to make a splash, dive into the waves at Bondi Beach or hang ten at nearby Manly Beach. 

Dabble in the city‚Äôs history, architecture, and beach towns, and embark on several Sydney tours during your next trip to the capital of New South Walves. To jump-start your adventure and get more tips and ideas on how to spend your Sydney sojourn, check out our travel guide video.

q80bY-WvEQE,Mexico City Travel Guide,"Our Mexico City Travel Guide! This wonderful city is truly the star of one our best episodes ever.

I have never fallen in love with a city quite as quickly as I fell in love with Mexico City. The Mexican capital is everything I want in a city; sprawling, loud, exciting, creative, friendly, and absolutely delicious. 

Our Mexico City guide is one of our longest episodes ever and I feel every second is justified as this city has so much to offer. The food section alone is packed full of deliciousness - don't watch on an empty stomach!

cS-hFKC_RKI,Tokyo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Tokyo.d179900.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Tokyo, the capital of Japan and the epitome of the word ‚Äúmegacity.‚Äù

In this vast metropolis, ancient traditions blend with futuristic buildings, and your Tokyo sightseeing will take you to representations of each. Pay your respects at temples set in forested hillsides, then flex your credit card in one of the shopping districts, before sitting down to a five-star meal‚Ä¶all in one day.

Your Tokyo tour begins with the subway and train system, which will take you all over this sprawling city. Tokyo is home to some 35 million people, many of which you‚Äôll meet as its public transit carries you throughout its many neighborhoods. Make a stop in Asakusa, a temple district nestled in leafy trees with skyscrapers towering in the background. There you‚Äôll visit Nakamisi Dori, a street loaded with food vendors and religious charms. Get to know the city a little better in the Harajuku district, home to cutting-edge fashion, a thriving, youth-centered culture, and the famous Yoyogi Park. The park stands out in stern contrast to the rest of the neighborhood; this sprawling, 134-acre green space is where locals slow down after a frenzied week of work and play.

 As night falls, make your way to Shinjuku. Many of Tokyo‚Äôs premier restaurants and pubs span Shinjuku‚Äôs streets, and you can indulge in succulent 5-star meals or sample with fast food from local vendors. Watch a movie, do some karaoke, and linger with fellow travelers and friendly locals alike.

What was your favorite part of Tokyo?

lqSoLVkYYu0,Traveling Iran by train | DW Documentary,"Iran is opening its doors to foreigners and a train ride from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea is a great way to get to know the country and its people.

The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life ‚Äì and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. 

The country‚Äôs most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.

Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.

During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.

In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin‚Äôs major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea.

qvuv6bg9dgQ,OUR BIGGEST TRAVEL FAIL! | Day 4 | Vietnam Vlogs 2019,"When you‚Äôre young, it makes sense to go out on a limb and do something more adventurous when traveling abroad. You see the backpackers on Instagram living it up in Asia, travel bloggers living the nomad lifestyle, and it looks so fun, easy and exciting. When I imagined our trip to Ha Long I imagined all of that. 

We booked a homestay (AirBnB of Vietnam) for one night in Ha Long before our cruise in the bay the next day. I figured we had the accommodation set up. Now all we had to do was get there and start exploring. It‚Äôs 2019, this should be easy with smart phones and google maps and Grab (Uber of Vietnam). Ha. Umm. Well‚Ä¶ 

Let's just say the entire day was one big fail.

A-63Yawo0zI,Learn English - Travel Vocabulary,"http://www.engvid.com/ Learn important, basic words you will need when you travel. Knowing a little English vocabulary can help a lot when you are travelling. Whever you are going in the world, you can almost always find someone who speaks some English. I'll teach you how a ""tourist attraction"" is different from a ""tourist trap"". What about ""sight seeing""? Do you know what an ""itinerary"" is? Do you have your travel documents? Get ready for your English to take flight! http://www.engvid.com/travel-vocabulary/

Hi. James, from EngVid. I was just about to plan my vacation. I'm going to take a long flight to Europe. I'm trying to remember luggage and baggage things, you know? It's kind of hard to do. But this is a lesson for you if you've been working a lot, you need some time off. Now, there's a video I would like you to go check out. That's on time off. It goes with this one. You might want to go away somewhere and not just stay home, right? So this video is for you. This is basic vocabulary on vacation. When you leave and maybe you go to an English speaking country and you want to practice your English, this stuff will be good for you to enjoy your time there, also to make it easy for you when you arrive. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Mr. E, Mr. E! It's a mystery where he is. It's no mystery. And you thought I forgot. Mr. E has been on vacation with me, and he's enjoying this particular attraction. So let's go to the board.

Now, if you're going to go on vacation, one of the first things you will have to do if you're leaving your country is you're going to need some travel documents. What are those? Documents. A ""document"" is a paper or something with information that tells you something is okay or outlines it for you. For example, your passport is a document given by the government with your picture on it that says you are a citizen of this country, and you are legal. You are a good person. Okay? Now, when you're leaving for a flight, or you want to go to another country, you're going to need travel documents first. Trust me; show up at the airport and go, ""I leave now. I go to Canada."" They will go, ""And the car is that way. Go home, crazy man. Okay?"" So we need travel documents. So what are ""travel documents""? Well, ""travel documents"" would be your passport, government identification, usually needed at most places the travel. Inside of a country, not necessary for most places. But leaving the country, you have to have it. Okay? So if you're in the European Union, no problem. If you're in Canada and the United States, you don't need one. But as soon as you leave these countries, you need a passport.

What's another thing you need? Well, you need what's called a ""boarding pass"". If you play soccer, you kick the ball; the other guy, he catches it; you ""pass"" right? The ball goes from one player to another. A ""boarding pass"" is what allows you to go from one country to another country. You show the person on the airplane this piece of paper with your passport, and they say, ""You know what? You can come on the plane and fly, like the pass."" Kick, catch, other country. Cool? All right. So these are your travel documents. You need those.

Now, I should have started with you need to make a plan because you want to go visit some place. You want to go on vacation, right? And if you want to go on vacation, well, going to have to -- I said ""vacation"". A ""vacation"" is a holiday, another word for saying ""time off from work"". All right? So you want to go on vacation. Sometimes, we say, ""We're going to vacation in Italy."" Or ""on my vacation, I want to visit Italy."" Or ""I'm taking a holiday in Italy."" Okay? So all these words, when people say, ""Well, what are you doing on your time off?"" You might go, ""I'm going on vacation."" Then they know you're leaving. If you just say, ""I'm taking time off from work"", you could be home cleaning. But no. You're saying, ""I'm going on vacation."" They're going to go, ""Where are you going to visit? Italy, perhaps? Sicily? Is it going to be a good holiday?"" And you go, ""Yes. I earned my time."" ""Earned"" means to work for something. ""I earned my time off. I'm going on vacation.""",travel

The Panama Canal is a 77.1-kilometre (48 mi) ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean (via the Caribbean Sea) to the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 metres (85 ft) above sea level. The current locks are 33.5 metres (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks is currently under construction and is due to open in 2016.

France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States took over the project in 1904, and took a decade to complete the canal, which was officially opened on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. The shorter, faster, and safer route to the U.S. West Coast and to nations in and around the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy. It takes between 20 and 30 hours to traverse the canal.

During construction, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American‚ÄìPanamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999, and is now managed and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a Panamanian government agency.

Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax. The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.",travel

There is a lot of conflicting information out there on the different websites for the dimensions of the suitcases. We wanted swivel wheels as well as the biggest carry-on that the airlines would allow. For each of the carryon suite cases, we examine the size, pockets, webbing, and handle.

Almost all airlines in 2018 state that the maximum carry-on suitcase dimensions are 9"" x 14"" x 22"". Two of these options actually measure larger, but we took them to the airport and tried them in the American Airlines, Allegiant Air, and United Airlines sizer bins to test them out.

Welcome to my vlog of My Millennial Life Crisis, or MLC for short. MLC is also short for Monica Lucy Church, my name! I'm hoping to get into daily vlogging. I'm not sure if I will be able to keep it up, but here goes nothing. I'm just a 20 something year old girl who dropped out of college to pursue a lifestyle on the internet. Lately I've been waking up finding myself unsatisfied with what I am doing. Like most people my age, I have no clue what to do with my life. I know what I'm good at and what I want out of life, so it's time to make a change.

ey_L_VzPwEI,Amsterdam Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Amsterdam.d178229.Destination-Travel-Guides

Amsterdam is the largest city in The Netherlands, also known as Holland. The fun-loving Dutch welcome 3.5 million tourists a year, making Amsterdam one of the top destinations in Europe.

No Amsterdam tour is complete without exploring some of its 165 canals and 1,000 bridges ‚Äì hopefully you like water. Don‚Äôt worry; you don‚Äôt need a boat or even a motor vehicle to get around. The heart of this ancient city is best seen on foot or from the seat of a bicycle. This city is rich in history; when you set out to explore ‚ÄúThe Venice of the North,‚Äù you‚Äôll find buildings dating back to the 13th century, as well as Dam Square and its royal palace. 

If you‚Äôve got an appreciation for fine art, your Amsterdam sightseeing should pause at the Rijksmuseum, where you can find the works of Rembrandt and other Dutch masters. Up for a pint? Stop by the old Heineken Brewery and learn about the lager brewing process. If you‚Äôre really feeling daring, grab a coffee in De Wallen, better known as one of the world‚Äôs oldest red light districts. You won‚Äôt get into trouble with your partner if you head there these days; it‚Äôs now home to cafes and adult stores.

Visit our Amsterdam travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

BIZARRE Coincidences You Need To See To Believe!

Deloreons, blue boxes, hot tubs, we are obsessed with time travel. While mainstream science wants us to believe that time is linear, some are saying that‚Äôs not quite it. Perhaps it is because we are so desperate to want to go back into the past and change our mistakes, or even try to change history itself! Time travel has been, and will always be, a major plot device for fiction. Books and movies will always come up with a new way for their characters to travel through time. But is it possible that time travel could actually exist? According to physicists, time travel does indeed exist and it‚Äôs already happened...several times! Why hasn‚Äôt this made the news? Well, think about it; if there‚Äôs word that time travel is possible, could you imagine the public outcry that would happen? People would say that the past happened for a reason that wasn‚Äôt natural and demand that we go back in time. What if a rip happened in the space-time continuum? There‚Äôs theories that Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves are time travelers too!

In this video, we‚Äôre going to tell you about ten theories that prove time travel actually exists. From disappearing aircraft carriers to modern technology popping up in ancient Greece and Egypt, these stories present a pretty compelling argument that we have the capability to hop around all over the timeline. There are video clips dating back to the early 1900‚Äôs of people walking around and talking on cell phones! Where did they even get their reception? Take a peek at this video and see what we‚Äôre talking about.

Finland‚Äôs thriving waterfront capital, Helsinki, is situated at the northeastern edge of the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Russia.

Start voyaging through Helsinki‚Äôs history by taking the ferry from Market Square to Suomenlinna Fortress, the battlements of which have protected the Gulf of Finland for almost 300 years. 

Helsinki has an abundance of museums and galleries across the city, including the Helsinki Design Museum, which features a permanent exhibition devoted to the great moments of Finnish design.

Continue your design journey at Temppeliaukio Church, a favorite with touring musicians. Helsinki is home to many structures dedicated to theatrical and musical productions. Two of the most iconic are Finlandia Hall and the Helsinki Music Centre. 

Wander through Esplanadi, often referred to as the living room of the city. From here, walk north to Senate Square, which fans out from the fatherly gaze of Emperor Alexander II. 

Climb the stairs to the foot of Helsinki Cathedral, a breathtaking whitewashed structure that towers above the rest of the city. Stare up at the twelve apostles, ten-foot-tall zinc statues which stand like wise custodians. 

In stark contrast to Helsinki Cathedral is its brooding younger brother, Uspenski Cathedral. Built with dark bricks, the cathedral is powerfully conspicuous as it rises from the surrounding white granite of the Katajanokka district. 

Celebrations of education and creativity mean Helsinki is a city designed for life. Its long-held reputation as one of the world‚Äôs happiest places lures people from all over the world. And now, it is calling to you.",travel

Long Island stretches eastward for 115 miles, from the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to the bluffs of Montauk Point.
¬†
Take the short train ride from Manhattan to the sands of Long Beach, which for many is where¬†Long Island¬†begins. From here, Long Island‚Äôs protective barrier islands continue all the way to Westhampton Island. Halfway along the chain, visit Fire Island Lighthouse, which for generations of immigrants was their first glimpse of America.
¬†
Many of those immigrants went on to create vast financial empires, and it was on Long Island‚Äôs¬†northern shores¬†where they built the mansions that would inspire F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs classic,¬†The Great Gatsby.

At the Cradle of Aviation Museum in nearby Hempstead, discover how Long Island launched generations of aviators into the wild blue yonder. Nearby, continue your flight into the past at the American Airpower Museum.
¬†
In the mid 1800s, well-to-do New Yorkers were drawn to the unspoiled beaches of Long Island‚Äôs East End. Today, the pioneer settlement of Southampton Village is a place where history and style have blended as smoothly as the spirits in a Long Island Iced Tea. The past been also been beautifully preserved in nearby Sag Harbor, a historic whaling port immortalized in Moby Dick.
¬†
Just a 30-minute drive east from Sag Harbor is Montauk, a place locals refer to as ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù.

Transcript:

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it‚Äôs one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver‚Äôs clean air is thanks to it‚Äôs really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn‚Äôt just a place, it‚Äôs a way of life. But it‚Äôs a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we‚Äôre going to help you make the most of it! We‚Äôre going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let‚Äôs get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward ‚Äì a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain ‚Äì it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

Now it‚Äôs not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There‚Äôs ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn‚Äôt too bad in our experience.",travel

N8bHCHl8X_0,Lisbon Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Lisbon-District.d178278.Destination-Travel-Guides

From its days as a Phoenician outpost to its expansion into a 16th¬†century trading giant, from the Great Earthquake of 1755 to its glorious reconstruction, Lisbon has long been a city of shifting fortunes.
¬†
Lisbon has forever been linked to the sea and it‚Äôs on the waterfront where you‚Äôll find the city‚Äôs grand gateway, Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio. Pass beneath the triumphal arch, a tribute to the city‚Äôs reconstruction, and drift down Rua Augusta to another of Lisbon‚Äôs great squares, the Rossio.
¬†
Climb aboard Tram 28, which passes some of the city‚Äôs most iconic sights, then climb the battlements of Castelo de S√£o Jorge to see the red tiled roofs of Lisbon spread out before you.
¬†
Although the Great Earthquake reduced much of Lisbon to rubble, the ancient suburb of Alfama was spared. Lose yourself amid the cobblestones, where cafes, bars and artisan shops have taken residence in the dockworkers homes of old. As the sun gets low, join locals in a fado bar to hear heartrending songs of the working class.
¬†
20 miles west of the city is Cascais, a sleepy fishing village until Lisbon‚Äôs nobility discovered its golden bays in the late 1800s.¬†¬†Another playground for Portugal‚Äôs Monarchs was Sintra, which¬†Hans Christian Andersen¬†called the most beautiful place in Portugal.
¬†

After Sintra,¬†spend a few days exploring some of Europe‚Äôs most beautiful beaches, such as Praia das Ma√ß√£s, Adraga and Ursa.¬†At Cape Roca, stand upon the clifftop, which until the 14th¬†century was considered¬†the end of the world.",travel

IguTMV4LfK4,Canada From Coast To Coast Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Traveling with the train through entire Canada.
Halifax is the capital of the province of Nova Scotia and the oldest British settlement in Canada.  One of the most impressive ways to explore Canada is to travel by train.   The journey across the second largest country in the world begins at the train station close to Halifax Harbour and travels from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast covering thousands of miles.  The trains of today‚Äôs Via Rail are both comfortable and nostalgic and their elevated panoramic windows provide an excellent view of Canada‚Äôs remarkable scenery. Quebec was founded in 1608 by famous explorer Samuel De Champlain but  the city‚Äôs most well known and prominent landmark is the 19th century Chateau Frontenac Hotel, the traditional stopover hotel of the Canadian Pacific Railway that offers first class service plus a lavish and historical ambience. Qu√©bec‚Äôs historic buildings, various gates, city walls and old houses that date back to the18th and 19th centuries are still in remarkably good condition.  Up until the late 18th century the city was a French possession but following several decades of hostilities the British finally conquered the city. In Montr√©al the architecture of bygone times blends in with the modern skyscrapers of today. Around three million people live in Canada‚Äôs second largest city, the biggest French-speaking metropolis outside France.  The Ville Souterraine, Underground City is an amazing world of shops and extends for almost thirty kilometres with a large network of tunnels, magnificent shopping arcades, hotel and cinema complexes and two thousand retail stores. The next stop on this journey across Canada is Toronto, one of the fastest growing cities in North America.   A prominent landmark is the fabulous CN Tower, the highest freestanding tower in the world.  Nearby is another spectacular building, the Skydome, a huge multi-purpose arena that can seat seventy thousand spectators and is home to the city‚Äôs baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays. Niagara Falls, The Rocky Mountains and the last stop on the journey, Vancouver ‚Äì one of the most beautiful cities in the world ‚Äì Canada is a truly vast paradise in a fast-changing world!

TRANSCRIPT

Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's video I'm going to talk about something I love, and that is travel. So, if you like travelling too, if you're planning on going on a vacation, or if you know somebody who's travelling, this video will be very, very helpful to you. In this video I'm going to teach you some very important verbs. They're all phrasal verbs, and I'll explain what a phrasal verb is in a moment. So, these are all verbs that we use when we're talking about travel. Okay.

So, to get started, I wanted to tell you a little bit about phrasal verbs. What is a phrasal verb? One of the difficulties students have with English are verbs where you have a verb and a preposition. So, when you see a verb and a preposition together, that's a phrasal verb. Now, you might be thinking: ""What's a preposition?"" Good question. I'm going to give you an example. We have here four words, each of these is a phrasal verb. They all have the verb ""get"": ""get in"", ""get up"", ""get on"", ""get over"", and there's many more, ""get away"". There's tons of them. Each of these actually can have multiple meanings, too. So, one of the most difficult parts about English is learning phrasal verbs, because this, the blue part is the preposition, it can change the meaning of the verb. Okay? So, prepositions are words like: ""on"", ""off"", ""up"", ""down"", ""toward"", ""over"", ""away"", these types of words are prepositions. So, you'll notice with phrasal verbs, they're very, very common in conversation. They're... You can write them down, too, but in general, when people talk they often use phrasal verbs. Okay? So, they're very, very important, especially when you're talking about going on a trip with your friends or family.

So let's look at some of the common phrasal verbs we use when we're talking about trips. The first verb I want to teach you: ""Drop off"". Okay? So: ""drop"" is the verb, ""off"" is the preposition, together: ""drop off"" is a phrasal verb. What does this mean: ""drop off""? When you ""drop someone off"" it means you're taking them to a place and then you leave them there. So, for example, maybe your friend needs to go to the airport, so you drive them to the airport and you drop them off at the airport. This means you take them there and you leave them in that place. Okay? So they don't come home with you; they stay there. So, for example, I have a friend named Frank, and when Frank goes travelling: ""We drop Frank off at the airport."" So, we drive Frank to the airport, he has all his luggage, his suitcases, and then we say to Frank: ""Goodbye, Frank, you know, have a nice trip."" We drop Frank off at the airport. You can also use ""drop off"" in a lot of other situations. For example, when you were a child maybe your parents, your mom or your dad, or maybe your grandparents dropped you off at school. This means that they took you to school, and then once you got to school, they would say goodbye to you and they would leave. So: ""drop off"" means you take someone to a place, and then you leave them there. You'll also notice... So, I have here the verb and the preposition. ""Frank"" is a name of a person and it's in the middle of ""drop"" and ""off"". Okay? So, these two are not together. We drop somebody off at the airport. Okay? So, sometimes with phrasal verbs... For some phrasal verbs you actually separate them, and you can put the names of somebody between them; for other ones you can't do that. For this one: ""drop off"", you put the name between the two... Between the verb and the preposition.

So, now let's look at another example of a common phrasal verb. ""See off"". Okay? So, again, we have ""off"" in both of these. ""See off"" is when... It's similar to ""drop off"", but it's a little bit different. Sometimes your family or your friends are going away for a long time, maybe they're going on a vacation or a trip, so you want to ""see them off"". It means you want to say goodbye to them at the airport, at the train station, maybe at their house. So, it's that goodbye you say before somebody goes off on a vacation. Okay? So, for example: ""We see Frank off."" Frank is going to Australia, so we go to the airport because we want to say goodbye to Frank, so: ""We see Frank off"" is another way to say: ""We say goodbye to Frank when he goes on his trip.""",travel

Kizu4Lg291g,Genoa (Italy) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Genoa in Italy.
Genoa is the fifth largest city in Italy.  Once a European Capital Of Culture, the city has an historical centre and harbour, as well as palaces, churches and narrow streets. We begin our tour of the city in the Villa Del Principe, a palazzo that was built for famous Admiral Of The Fleet, Andrea Doria, and created by Perino Del Vaga, a pupil of  Raffael. At the harbour, the Commenda Di Pr√© became the crusader‚Äòs hospice of the Order Of Jerusalem, which was followed by the Maltese Order of Knights in the fifteenth century. The Palazzo San Giorgio is the original seat of one of Italy‚Äôs first banks and was where Marco Polo was captured and from where he dictated his travels in China. Porto Antico has been transformed into a fine leisure centre.  A biosphere was created, designed by leading architect, Renzo Piano.  An extraordinary tropical greenhouse contains parrots and small reptiles. Palm trees adorn the promenade which has always been a popular destination for a relaxing stroll. Close to Via San Luca is the Palazzo Spinola, former residence of the noble Spinola Family, it has many original features.  Today it is the Galleria Nazionale featuring the works of international masters and also prominent Genoese artists. The famous Staglieno Cemetery is located near the station.  It is also tantamount to being an open-air museum of sculpture.  The splendour and vibrancy of the memorials is unique, a glorious necropolis. Genoa is portrayed in the cemetery as a cosmopolitan port city in which all religions are accepted in death. The capital of the Liguria region has always been the Gateway To The World, a mediaeval naval power made rich by maritime trade.  Genoa, dominator of the seas, is a metropolis in transition, a city that appeals to all of the senses!

San Pedro De Atacama is known for the Moon Valley (Valle de la luna) Death Valley (Valle de Marte) and otherworldly landscapes almost everywhere you look. 

I touch on some unexpected developments in this video too. The carnival celebrations were something I came upon purely by chance. Also, I thought I‚Äôd share a short story about an awkward, but memorable encounter at the celebrations. 

Will there be a 3rd video? I did put together a very rough edit, it‚Äôs about a part in the high mountains and my way back to Peru. But, many things came up and I wasn‚Äôt able to finish it. I already had other stuff in the pipeline and I had to prioritise that. What do you folks think? Want to see a 3rd part? Tell me in the comments.

GHDtG4_Eq_c,Philadelphia Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Philadelphia.d178297.Destination-Travel-Guides

Welcome to Philadelphia, considered the birthplace of the United States.

The Declaration of Independence was written and read publicly here in 1776. When you tour Philadelphia, you‚Äôll get a sense of the history that permeates the city through its numerous monuments, symbols, and other landmarks, such as the First Bank of the United States and the warship USS Olympia. Don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Liberty Bell and the remains of the Eastern State Penitentiary, which housed notorious criminals like Al Capone. 

You don‚Äôt need a car to enjoy your Philadelphia sightseeing; take public transportation or rent a bike to explore the city streets at your leisure. Fairmount Park is the perfect place for a stroll, and if you‚Äôve got kids, bring them to the Please Touch Museum, where they can enjoy interactive exhibits and displays that will educate and entertain. If you‚Äôve still got some energy after that, visit the Philadelphia Zoo and make friends with some of the animals. Don‚Äôt forget to sample some of the delicious food available in Philadelphia, particularly the fresh goods and cooked meals at the Italian Market. 

From culinary delicacies to historical importance, Philadelphia truly has it all. 

Visit our Philadelphia travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

For ages I‚Äôve been thinking about doing a video analyzing time travel in fiction and doing a comparison of different fictional time travels ‚Äì some do use wormholes, some relativistic/faster than light travel with time dilation, some closed timelike curves, some have essentially ‚Äúmagic‚Äù or no consistent rules that make any sense, or TARDIS's, or whatever. This video is an explanation of how time travel functions in different popular movies, books, & shows ‚Äì not how it works ‚Äúunder the hood"", but how it causally affects the perspective of characters‚Äô timelines (who has free will? can you change things by going back to the past or forwards into the future?). In particular, I explain Ender's Game, Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Primer, Bill & Ted‚Äôs Excellent Adventure, Back to the Future, Groundhog Day, Looper, the video game ‚ÄúBraid‚Äù, and Lifeline.

St. Petersburg 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3ISUUO0CSo

Kyoto:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd1wzlwtKJ0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The island of Santorini has a pretty explosive past. It‚Äôs perched over the remains of a much larger land mass that sank almost 4,000 years ago when a volcano blew its top, leaving the blue caldera and steep cliffs behind. 

It is these cliffs and the flooded caldera that have become Santorini‚Äôs iconic calling card, and the first stop on your Santorini tour. Here‚Äôs your first bit of trivia: The whitewashed homes that appear on so many postcards and photographs are larger than they appear on the outside. They‚Äôre partially built into existing cliffside caves, and feature some of the most distinctive Mediterranean architecture you‚Äôll ever see. 

Santorini sightseeing will no doubt bring you up the stairs and pathways to the blue-domed churches that stand guard over the island. From there, you can take in the exquisite view of the caldera and harbor below. If you get a little weary of the spectacular sights, don‚Äôt worry; there‚Äôs plenty of things to do besides wander the various clifftop towns. If you head down to water level, you can soak in the warm surf, explore Santorini‚Äôs many beaches, go for a drive along winding roads, or go on a fishing expedition from one of the harbors. 

At the end of the day, gather with the residents and visitors atop the cliff towns and watch the sun drop into the ocean. You‚Äôll never see a view quite like it.

What part of Santorini do you want to see?

N3ISUUO0CSo,St. Petersburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Four hundred miles west of Moscow is St. Petersburg, Russia. A striking city resting on the banks of the Neva River, St. Petersburg has long been a draw for lovers of architecture, as St. Petersburg tours often begin with the city's legendary structures.

Enter a world of towering cathedrals, palaces, and gardens, many of them set down by the order of Peter the Great in the 18th century. As the decades passed, later members of Russian royalty added to the city's opulence by constructing additional marvels. Walk through the Palace Square, located in the heart of St. Petersburg and home of the Winter Palace, the sprawling home of Catherine the Great. Next, pay a visit to St. Isaac's Cathedral and its gold-plated dome, which glitters in the sunshine. If you walk to the top of its dome, you will be rewarded with astonishing views of the city.

Continue your St. Petersburg sightseeing by taking a boat ride down the river to Peterhof Gardens & Palace. This gilded structure and its lush array of plant life was constructed to rival France's Palace of Versailles, and is a popular place for a quiet walk in nature or to reflect upon the engineering marvel of its 60 fountains, all of which flow continuously without the use of pumps. 

Spend your evening walking along Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's main thoroughfare. Besides offering even more beautiful architecture to gaze upon, Nevsky Prospect is loaded with restaurants and boutiques. Enjoy a delicious meal, shop around for the perfect Russian souvenir, and plan the itinerary for your next day in this magnificent city.

Time Travel Explained | Did Gautama Buddha Time Travel ? | Sadhguru | Adiyogi

Sadhguru relates time travel to instances of people who don't have control over their imaginations. Instead, he discusses the concept of creation of bodies periodically through time. The experience of time and how life experiences time is very different. There are multiple perspectives of time that one must consider when questioning time travel.

Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. An arresting blend of profundity and pragmatism, his life and work serves as a reminder that yoga is a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.

LcKnx7I97yk,Dublin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Despite a long and sometimes tragic history of invasion and resistance, this thriving business capital has poetry, music and literature percolating through its cobblestones.

Dubliner, Oscar Wilde once said ‚Äúlife is too important to be taken seriously.‚Äù While Dublin proudly honours its past, it is equally passionate about enjoying each and every new day. Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city‚Äôs nearly 700 pubs. Nothing matters more to Dubliners than having a good time or, as locals call it, the craic.

Of all the gifts, Dublin has given to the world, perhaps the most intoxicating are its stories. Originally built for the sons of the Irish gentry, the ivy-covered stone buildings of Trinity College are home to some of the oldest remaining manuscripts in the world, including the 1000-year-old Book of Kells.

Dubliner Jonathan Swift, once said, ‚ÄúMay you live all the days of your life.‚Äù There is no better way to define Dublin. Its passion for life is contagious, captivating and sure to stay with you for the rest of your days.

9fJEFi3ccwI,Yosemite National Park Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Yosemite-National-Park.d180672.Destination-Travel-Guides

Yosemite National Park sits on the western slopes of California‚Äôs Sierra Nevada Mountains. Most visitors spend their time in Yosemite Valley, which despite being only 7 miles long and 1 mile wide, packs in more jaw-dropping scenery than just about any other place on Earth. 
 
Near the valley entrance stop at Tunnel View, and stand before a panorama that‚Äôs reduced generations of visitors to silence. From Tunnel View it‚Äôs just a short drive to Bridalveil Fall. Fed by snowmelt, the fall reaches its thundering peak in May. 
 
The Yosemite Valley ring road follows the banks of the Merced River, which shifts in character as it thunders from the valley walls, before gently winding across the valley floor. The ring road is dotted with trailheads that lead to 800 miles of hiking trails. The Four Mile Trail climbs the valley‚Äôs southern wall to two of Yosemite‚Äôs great outlooks, Glacier Point and Washburn Point. Further along the ring road is the trailhead for The Mist Trail, which offers stunning views of Vernal and Nevada Falls. 
 
For thousands of years, the Ahwaneechee had villages throughout this valley, but it was at the base of Yosemite Falls where their great chief resided. Take the one-hour hike to the lower falls, or spend the day climbing all the way to the upper falls.

8TJdP1Uf9x8,Japan: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar 2/5,"Japan: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar gives you all the info you need to explore the land of the rising sun. Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
Japan remains one of the most intensely fascinating places in the world, effortlessly intertwining modernity and tradition. Seek serenity in Kyoto by visiting one of thousands of temples spread throughout this former capital, or go skiing in Niseko or summit Mt. Fuji. Of course you can also kick back in one of the country‚Äôs many hot springs, where the rich mountain minerals will leave your skin feeling brand new. Once you‚Äôve achieved maximum relaxation, hit up Tokyo‚Äôs bustling night life or go hiking in Kamakura. 

What Japan lacks in square footage it makes up for in endless options for your itinerary. In this case, size definitely doesn‚Äôt matter! Consider booking a tour that allows you to see all of the country‚Äôs unique highlights, without missing the subtleties you can enjoy as a backpacker: http://www.tourradar.com/d/japan

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the region you‚Äôre visiting, and if you‚Äôre planning on travelling from the North to the South outside of summer months, make sure you bring everything from flip-flops to snow boots. 

Japan‚Äôs currency is the Japanese Yen. Credit card and debit transactions aren‚Äôt common, so be sure to bring plenty of cash with you no matter where you travel within the country. Dining out doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you can often enjoy a pre-fix menu for lunch for a very reasonable cost. Be sure to sample the Japanese whiskeys, as Japan is an expert whiskey distiller! 

‚Äî About Japan ‚Äî

With a population of nearly 130 million, this island nation is resides in the Pacific Ocean and has everything from dense cities to mountainous national parks. You‚Äôll discover that there‚Äôs countless reasons to move Japan up to the #1 spot on your bucket list. Sixty-six percent of the country is covered by trees and the Japanese enjoy the highest life expectancy in the world at 83.7 years.

Jd1wzlwtKJ0,Kyoto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Kyoto, Japan, has long been considered one of the country‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Once the capital of the nation, Kyoto is now an ultra-modern haven that retains a great deal of its ancient charm.

To see some of this long-established glamour, make your way to Kyoto Tower. Just two miles east of the tower is Gion, an entertainment quarter and home to many of Kyoto‚Äôs famous geishas. As you walk east through Gion, you‚Äôll find even more old architecture, including several Ryokan, or traditional Japanese inns. Many date back to the Edo period, which ranged from 1603 to 1868. 

During your Kyoto tour, take a rickshaw ride to the Sannen-zaka and Ninen-zaka districts, where cars are prohibited and traditional teahouses and temples adorn the nearby landscape. Kyoto is known as ‚ÄúThe City of Ten Thousand Shrines‚Äù for good reason. Walk through the great open plazas of the Haian Shrine, or spend a quiet moment in the intimate confines of the Shorenin Temple and its beautiful gardens.  

The most famous of Kyoto‚Äôs temples is Fushimi Inari-taisha, a stunning red complex that sprawls over Mount Inari, which is named after and dedicated to Inari, the fox spirit. A hike to the summit takes about two hours, and will lead you through thousands of colorful sub-shrines and thick, ancient forest. Once you‚Äôre at the top, you‚Äôll have a stunning view of Kyoto. 

What is your favorite part of Kyoto?

c4z6RZXv5p8,Interstellar Travel: Approaching Light Speed,"Is interstellar travel doomed to remain in the realm of science fiction? Sticking to near future space propulsion only, how close can we get to the speed of light?

This video looks at the current spacecraft speed records with Apollo 10 holding the record for the fastest manned spacecraft, New Horizons probe for the fastest Earth escape velocity and the Helios probes for the fastest heliocentric velocity. But Solar Probe Plus will beat that when it launches in 2018. While Voyager 1 doesn't set any speed records, it was the first spacecraft to leave the solar system, so therefore the fastest solar system escape velocity by default.

For beating these speeds, this video explores what is possible in the near future only, so no antimatter, Alcubierre drives (warp), ramjets, etc... The EM drive is left out until it's proven with actual reproducible results in space.

Project Daedalus and the updated Project Icarus represent sound concepts for fusion spacecraft. IKAROS was the first successful demonstration of solar sail technology but hopefully the planetary society is not far behind with their LightSail cubsat (not covered in this video).

But what appears to have the most potential to reach the nearest star to our own, Proxima Centauri and it's newly discovered planet Proxima b is Breakthrough Starshot. Thousands of super lightweight laser sail nanocraft will be launched into space then the light beamer, a ground based laser array will propel these spacecraft to 20% light speed within minutes.

6VYB3a9bbiA,24 CRAZY SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS YOU`VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,"We have a lot of things stored in the kitchen, with which you can put interesting experiments for children. And for yourself to make a couple of discoveries and wonder why you never noticed this before? 
One of the most interesting experiments you can do at home is elastic eggs! You have no idea how that's possible? It's easy! This experiment is a classic example of an acid base reaction. This reaction dissolves the shell, but leaves the inner membrane intact, creating a bare egg.
Put the egg in a glass jar. Add vinegar. Pour enough vinegar to cover the egg, and a little more. First the eggs swim, but then they sink.
Watch the bubbles! Within a minute of adding vinegar, tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide appear on the eggshell. This is one part of the chemical reaction that takes place inside the jar.
Close the lid and leave for a few days, and can be a week. The egg will get a little bigger. The brown color of the eggshell pales. A layer of scale appears on the surface of the vinegar. You can replace the vinegar in a couple of days.
After a week, carefully remove the egg from the vinegar. Wash and wipe gently. You will see that the eggshell has become soft, it is pliable even with a light touch. It's like a naked egg!
Naked eggs are really cool. The inner membrane remains intact, so the eggs are quite fragile. They can be squeezed gently. The eggs are translucent, so you can see the yolk, which, interestingly, always floats up.
If you drop a bare egg from a very low height (about 2-3 cm), it is likely to bounce like a rubber ball. (Be careful, it gets dirty and can burst!).

7. NEKO
Thanks to her exceptionally well-hidden grave on the Greek island of Sikinos, a noblewoman named Neko and her precious gold jewelry remained undiscovered for 1,800 years. Greek archaeologists discovered Neko‚Äôs grave in 2018. Grave robbers didn‚Äôt miss out on her treasures for a lack of trying - in fact, they hit various other tombs on Sikinos, which is part of the Cyclades archipelago. 

6. MAGNETIC STATUES
In a park within a small town called La Democracia, which is located near the Pacific Guatemalan coast, there‚Äôs a series of 11 ancient stone ‚Äúpotbelly‚Äù sculptures on display. Surprisingly, these sculptures are magnetized on certain parts, indicating that the pre-Columbian civilization that crafted them may have had a knowledge of magnetism.

5. SANDBY BORG
Around 1,600 years ago, a gruesome fight occurred at a fort called Sandby Borg on Sweden‚Äôs √ñland Island. Hundreds of people were killed in the attack and left unburied. After the attack, the site was left alone by neighbors, leading researchers to believe that it was considered a taboo place.

4. Panga ya Saidi
The 1,076-square-foot main chamber of the Panga Ya Saidi cave network in Kenya‚Äôs Rift Valley bears evidence of 78,000 continuous years of human occupation. Let that sink in for a minute! It sits where grassland meets with coastal tropical forest, thus providing its former inhabitants with the convenient ability to exploit resources from both environments. 

3. THOUSANDS OF TEETH
On two separate occasions in 2018, batches of over 1,000 teeth were discovered in different parts of the world. Last year, archaeologists conducting a preliminary excavation at the site of a future subway station began uncovering teeth. They ultimately collected over 1,000 teeth, which were estimated to be around a century old.

2. ATA
In 2003, someone discovered a naturally-mummified, six-inch-tall skeleton near a ghost town in the Chilean Atacama Desert. The skeleton was female and had unusually hard bones for her size, as well as a conical-shaped head. Rumors quickly spread that the skeleton was that of an alien. In 2012, a doctor named Steven Greer analyzed the skeleton, who was named Ata, using x-ray and CT imaging. 

1. A RARE PAINTING OF JESUS
Earlier this year, archaeologists from the University of Haifa announced the discovery of a rare early painting of Jesus inside an ancient church in the Israeli village of Shivta. The 1,500-year-old depiction of Jesus looks quite different from the popular Western image of him. It was found in the Negev Desert of southern Israel among the ruins of a Byzantine-era farming village.

Re6IhsqOIv8,Life Probably Exists Beyond Earth - Space Science Documentary - Where Are We in the Universe?,"Since the beginning of civilization, humanity has wondered whether we are alone in the universe. As NASA has explored our solar system and beyond, it has developed increasingly sophisticated tools to address this fundamental question. Within our solar system, NASA‚Äôs missions have searched for signs of both ancient and current life, especially on Mars and soon, Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa. Beyond our solar system, missions, such as Kepler and TESS, are revealing thousands of planets orbiting other stars. The explosion of knowledge of planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, and the results of decades of research on signatures of life - what scientists call biosignatures - have encouraged NASA to address, in a scientifically rigorous way, whether humanity is alone. Beyond searching for evidence of just microbial life, NASA now is exploring ways to search for life advanced enough to create technology.",science

Society has always been in a bare knuckle fight with Mother Nature. Going toe to toe with some of her more interesting jabs and punches. Testing ourselves, and oftentimes losing, to hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, Tsunamis and meteor strikes. We‚Äôve become accustomed to these attacks‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ every so often, nature has a trick up her sleeve; an Ace that comes out of nowhere and really floors us. 

One two strikes that although natural have no rational cause. Today we are going to list 10 strange unexplained phenomena that stomp science.

4i48EeMM1l0,25 SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS TO BLOW YOUR MIND,"Do you know that if you put an egg in vinegar for two days, the shell will dissolve and the egg will become elastic? Under the influence of vinegar, calcium, which makes up the shell, dissolves and disappears in the form of gas bubbles.  

Only the film between the shell and the egg remains intact. It turns out funny egg that looks like jelly. The egg increases slightly in size as it is saturated with vinegar. You can play with the egg as a ball. The film is very thin and, therefore, may be torn if handled carelessly. If you experiment with a boiled egg, it will become as elastic as a rubber ball. If you add a highlighter dye to vinegar, you will get a luminous elastic egg. 

I will show you how to make a similarity of crystals from sugar syrup and ice cubes. I'll show you a simple and very beautiful trick with soaring tea bags, we can call it ""Rocket Soaring"". When burning air heats up and rises up, forming a stream of hot air. When a bag burns and its weight becomes such that this flow can lift it, the light remnants of an almost burnt bag rise too.

Also look at the trick with a tennis ball and hairdryer, the trick with a candle, the trick with a balancing tin can, and others.

As seen throughout the films, the Noisy Cricket packs a serious punch, but can science tell us just how powerful this tiny weapon is? Agent K suits up as he breaks it all down in this week's Because Science!

Have you ever heard about something that is unexplained? There are a lot of bizarre things in the world such as animals raining from the sky, or weird unexplained heat anomalies found inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Sometimes the answer is found, and sometimes these things remain a mystery that science cannot explain. Check out these 10 Natural Phenomena that Science Can‚Äôt Explain. 

10. Mammatus clouds ‚Äì which means ""mammary cloud"", is a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud, these are typically heavy cumulonimbus rainclouds. Mammatus are most often associated with severe weather, and they can appear before or after a storm. 

9. 'Heat anomaly' found in Great Pyramid of Giza ‚Äì Scientists have been studying the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and have found strange heat signatures that have no explanation.

8. Oakville Blobs - On August 7, 1994 during a rainstorm, blobs of translucent gelatinous substance fell in the town of Oakville, Washington. Several attempts were made to identify the blobs. 

7. Lake Hillier, Australia - Australia is the home of unusual ‚Äòpink lakes‚Äô. Lake Hillier is one of them. Located on Middle Island, this body of water is famous for it‚Äôs remarkable bubble gum pink color. 600 meters long and surrounded by a rim of sand and thick woods of eucalyptus trees, this pink lake still surprises and intrigues scientists.

6. Socotra Island, Yemen - Want to feel like you‚Äôre visiting another planet? Check out Socotra Island off the coast of Yemen. It has been called the most alien-looking place on Earth, and a ‚Äòlost world‚Äô because the heat and drought conditions of the island have produced around 800 rare species of flora and fauna, and a third of those can‚Äôt be seen anywhere else on the planet. 

5. Kelimutu, Indonesia - Mount Kelimutu is a volcano in Flores, Indonesia. The mountain has three volcanic crater lakes that vary colors from each other at different times, making them surreal and exciting to be discovered. 

4. Brain Injury Turns Man Into Math Genius - After being brutally attacked in 2002, Jason Padgett now sees the world through a geometric lens. His devastating injury seems to have unlocked part of his brain that makes everything in his world appear to have a mathematical structure. 

3. Stonehenge - For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over Stonehenge, which took Neolithic builders around 1,500 years to build. Located in Southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout. 

2. Animal rain phenomenon - The origins of this bizarre animal rain phenomenon have evolved throughout history. The first reported phenomenon occurred in the first century AD, when Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented fish and frogs raining from the sky. 

1. Tsingy de Bemaraha, Madagascar - The Tsingy de Bemaraha is a national park located in the Melaky Region, northwest Madagascar. The site is unique with its biodiversity and exceptional landscape called the Tsingy - which can be translated into "" where one cannot walk barefoot"".",science

HQx5Be9g16U,10 Amazing Science Tricks Using Liquid!,"Add me on Facebook (click LIKE on Facebook to add me) - http://www.facebook.com/brusspup

iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/over-rain-single/id1033695238
Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Over-Rain-brusspup/dp/B014JXPNSW/

Detailed information for the tricks in the video:

1. Slow motion ball:

You need a thick liquid, preferably honey, a heavy ball, and a sphere shaped container. Place the heavy ball in the lower half of the sphere. Fill the lower half of the container with honey a little more than half.
If you use too little or too much, it will affect the motion of the ball.

2. Water fire starter. Credit goes to The King of Random for this idea. Be sure to check out his channel. He has a huge selection of amazing how to experiments. https://www.youtube.com/user/01032010814

You need a plastic or glass container with a curved area. The Pom bottles work great. Fill the bottle with water. Fold 2 sheets of paper in half, twice. Print or scribble a black mark on one of the sheets. On a sunny day hold the bottle near the paper, focusing the light on the black area of the paper. Once it starts to smoke and a hole begins to form, wrap the other sheet of paper around the smoking piece. Wave the papers through the air to feed oxygen to the spark. Continue this until the paper catches on fire.

3.  No-leak magic bag:
     Al you need is a zip baggy, pencils and water. Fill the bag almost to the top. Zip it shut, and start sticking pencils through the bag. Sometimes a few drops will leak out, but overall, this is a simple yet impressive trick

4. Liquid Stacking:
You'll need a tall glass or bottle. Dish Soap, vegetable oil, dark corn syrup, rubbing alcohol, water and food coloring.

First add the dark corn syrup, then dish soap, then add food coloring to the water and pour it in with the bottle tilted, then add the vegetable oil (bottle tilted), and finally add food coloring to the alcohol and pour it in with the bottle tilted.

5. Invisible Bottle:

You need glycerin, a glass and a bottle that will fit in the glass. Fill both glass and bottle with glycerin and place the bottle in the glass. It looks like the bottle disappears.

6. Dancing Liquid:

You need  a powered speaker, a tone generator (can be found online), corn starch, water and plastic to protect the speaker. Pour 1/2 cup of corn starch in a bowl and 1/4 cup of water. Mix. Pour the liquid into the speaker and generate a 60hz tone.

7. Magic Water Barrier:

You need 2 of the same glasses. Hot water, cold water, food coloring and a thin piece of plastic or cardboard. Pour the hot water in 1 glass, the cold in the other glass, add food coloring, then place the plastic on top of the hot water glass. Turn the glass upside down, place it on top of the cold water glass, then carefully remove the plastic. Hot water is less dense than cold water, so it ""floats"" on top of the cold water.

8. Leidenfrost effect:

You need a pan, water and a stove. Turn the heat on high for about 4 minutes then add the water. This experiment can stain your pans.

9. Reverse Illusion:

Add all sorts of images or words behind a glass, then watch as it reverses when you add water in the glass.

10. Reversing Liquid:

You need 1 big glass, 1 smaller glass, 3 mixing glasses, corn syrup, pipettes, food coloring, and clips.

First pour the corn syrup into the 2 bigger glasses. Place the smaller glass inside of the bigger glass. Attach the clips to prevent the smaller glass from moving side to side in the bigger glass. Pour a small amount of corn syrup into the 3 mixing glasses. Add food coloring and stir. Fill each pipette with a different color, then add the colored corn syrup to your big glass. Turn the smaller glass carefully and watch the colors mix. Turn it back and watch them unmix.

-otqRMCwFXc,This Is What Happens When You Donate Your Body To Science,"This is what happens when you donate your body to science. Have you ever thought about donating your body to science? After all, at that point you won‚Äôt be needing it anymore, so why not leave it to someone who can put it to good use? Here‚Äôs what happens when you donate your body to science.

#Science #Experiments #Biology

What Happens To Your Body Next?: 5:06

Summary:
Body donation is usualy overseen by an accredited organization or nonprofit, such as the donation program for a university. There is a screening process; during this process, potential donors are interviewed and examined to determine whether or not they are suitable for body donation.

Unlike organ donation, your physical age does not play a factor when it comes to donating your body to science. Doesn't matter if your 25 or 95 years old, you will always be considered a suitable potential candidate for body donation.

After screening process, the organization will keep your information on file until you pass away. Once you pass away. Once you pass away, the organization performs a medical assessment on your body to determine whether or not is still suitable for collection. 

If your chosen resting place was in the hands of a non profit program or organization, the next step is for that non profit to match your body with people who can make use of it: this usually menas that your body will go to medical researchers or educators with short term needs.

Once your body has expended its usefulness in the scientific community, your remains are cremated afterwards. If requested, your cremated remains may also be sent to your loved ones along with an official death certificate. Your next of kin may also receive a letter informing them of the experiments and scientific advancements that your body was used to facilitate. That way, all of your friends and family can know just how much of a contribution your corpse made in the name of scientific progress.

10. The Ulfberht Swords
Ulfberht swords were the weapon of choice of the Vikings, along with other tribes around northern Europe. They had a long, double edged blade, and a straight crossbar over the grip. There are only about 170 still known to exist today, each of which dates to between the 9th and 11th centuries! And the cool thing is they have the tell-tale inscription in the blade itself.

9. The Drepanosaurus
Whenever a new fossil is found, it gives further clues as to the evolution of animals, and of those that once roamed the earth. Every now and then, though, something is found that makes no sense at all in terms of scientific understanding, and requires a complete re-think of what is taken as fact. This is exactly what‚Äôs happening with a little known creature, the Drepanosaurus.

8. Rat Kings
The Rat Kings are a rare phenomena from the animal kingdom that is so bizarre, no-one is entirely sure how it happens. You may have seen one before, but if you haven‚Äôt- they really are something quite unusual. They have been a part of legend for centuries, and are formed when a number of rats become attached by the tail.

7. The Martian Meteorite
In 1984, a meteorite fell to earth, something that in itself is no unusual thing. But this one, known as ALH84001, was found to hold secrets that no-one has been able to explain. The 4.1 billion-year-old rock is thought to have originated on Mars, having been dislodged during a collision, and floated through space until it fell into earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Unlike other similar specimens, the surface of this rock had something very unusual- what appeared to be the signs of fossilised bacteria. 

6. The Longyou Grottoes
The Longyou Grottoes are a series of underground structures near the village of Shiyan Beicun, in the Zhejiang province in China. They are thought to be at least 2000 years old, but scientists and researchers have no idea how they were built, what they were used for, or even who was responsible for them.

5. What was the first dinosaur?
Since we first realized that dinosaurs roamed the earth, palaeontologists have been trying to understand the full range of creatures that once lived, with particular interest revolving around which was the first dinosaur to ever live.

4. The Nampa Stone Doll
The Nampa figurine looks like any other that has been made by an ancient civilisation. The mystery surrounding this one, though, is how it came to be in the place where it was found. It was discovered in 1889 near the town of Nampa in Idaho. Workers were searching for water, and dug a well, which involved drilling a borehole to 295 feet. 

3. The Piri Reis Map
Today we take maps for granted. Satellite technology combined with the work of cartographers over the years, plus Google of course, have created incredibly detailed depictions of our planet. All we have to do is use our smartphone! This wasn‚Äôt always the way, clearly, and maps from centuries ago were just kind of close approximations based on ship voyages.

2. The Voynich Manuscript
The 600 year old Voynich manuscript is often thought of as being the most mysterious book that has ever been written, and still, to this day, scientists aren‚Äôt able to explain what‚Äôs inside. 

1. Dinosaur and Human Footprints
The final mystery is one which calls into question the idea that humans weren‚Äôt around at the time of the dinosaurs, because their footprints have been found side by side. The discovery was made in the Paluxy river, Texas, where hundreds of dinosaur footprints have been found. Their foot impressions were perfectly preserved by the river bed.

7. NEKO
Thanks to her exceptionally well-hidden grave on the Greek island of Sikinos, a noblewoman named Neko and her precious gold jewelry remained undiscovered for 1,800 years. Greek archaeologists discovered Neko‚Äôs grave in 2018. Grave robbers didn‚Äôt miss out on her treasures for a lack of trying - in fact, they hit various other tombs on Sikinos, which is part of the Cyclades archipelago. 

6. MAGNETIC STATUES
In a park within a small town called La Democracia, which is located near the Pacific Guatemalan coast, there‚Äôs a series of 11 ancient stone ‚Äúpotbelly‚Äù sculptures on display. Surprisingly, these sculptures are magnetized on certain parts, indicating that the pre-Columbian civilization that crafted them may have had a knowledge of magnetism.

5. SANDBY BORG
Around 1,600 years ago, a gruesome fight occurred at a fort called Sandby Borg on Sweden‚Äôs √ñland Island. Hundreds of people were killed in the attack and left unburied. After the attack, the site was left alone by neighbors, leading researchers to believe that it was considered a taboo place.

4. Panga ya Saidi
The 1,076-square-foot main chamber of the Panga Ya Saidi cave network in Kenya‚Äôs Rift Valley bears evidence of 78,000 continuous years of human occupation. Let that sink in for a minute! It sits where grassland meets with coastal tropical forest, thus providing its former inhabitants with the convenient ability to exploit resources from both environments. 

3. THOUSANDS OF TEETH
On two separate occasions in 2018, batches of over 1,000 teeth were discovered in different parts of the world. Last year, archaeologists conducting a preliminary excavation at the site of a future subway station began uncovering teeth. They ultimately collected over 1,000 teeth, which were estimated to be around a century old.

2. ATA
In 2003, someone discovered a naturally-mummified, six-inch-tall skeleton near a ghost town in the Chilean Atacama Desert. The skeleton was female and had unusually hard bones for her size, as well as a conical-shaped head. Rumors quickly spread that the skeleton was that of an alien. In 2012, a doctor named Steven Greer analyzed the skeleton, who was named Ata, using x-ray and CT imaging. 

1. A RARE PAINTING OF JESUS
Earlier this year, archaeologists from the University of Haifa announced the discovery of a rare early painting of Jesus inside an ancient church in the Israeli village of Shivta. The 1,500-year-old depiction of Jesus looks quite different from the popular Western image of him. It was found in the Negev Desert of southern Israel among the ruins of a Byzantine-era farming village.

Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Over-Rain-brusspup/dp/B014JXPNSW/

Detailed information for the tricks in the video:

1. Slow motion ball:

You need a thick liquid, preferably honey, a heavy ball, and a sphere shaped container. Place the heavy ball in the lower half of the sphere. Fill the lower half of the container with honey a little more than half.
If you use too little or too much, it will affect the motion of the ball.

2. Water fire starter. Credit goes to The King of Random for this idea. Be sure to check out his channel. He has a huge selection of amazing how to experiments. https://www.youtube.com/user/01032010814

You need a plastic or glass container with a curved area. The Pom bottles work great. Fill the bottle with water. Fold 2 sheets of paper in half, twice. Print or scribble a black mark on one of the sheets. On a sunny day hold the bottle near the paper, focusing the light on the black area of the paper. Once it starts to smoke and a hole begins to form, wrap the other sheet of paper around the smoking piece. Wave the papers through the air to feed oxygen to the spark. Continue this until the paper catches on fire.

3.  No-leak magic bag:
     Al you need is a zip baggy, pencils and water. Fill the bag almost to the top. Zip it shut, and start sticking pencils through the bag. Sometimes a few drops will leak out, but overall, this is a simple yet impressive trick

4. Liquid Stacking:
You'll need a tall glass or bottle. Dish Soap, vegetable oil, dark corn syrup, rubbing alcohol, water and food coloring.

First add the dark corn syrup, then dish soap, then add food coloring to the water and pour it in with the bottle tilted, then add the vegetable oil (bottle tilted), and finally add food coloring to the alcohol and pour it in with the bottle tilted.

5. Invisible Bottle:

You need glycerin, a glass and a bottle that will fit in the glass. Fill both glass and bottle with glycerin and place the bottle in the glass. It looks like the bottle disappears.

6. Dancing Liquid:

You need  a powered speaker, a tone generator (can be found online), corn starch, water and plastic to protect the speaker. Pour 1/2 cup of corn starch in a bowl and 1/4 cup of water. Mix. Pour the liquid into the speaker and generate a 60hz tone.

7. Magic Water Barrier:

You need 2 of the same glasses. Hot water, cold water, food coloring and a thin piece of plastic or cardboard. Pour the hot water in 1 glass, the cold in the other glass, add food coloring, then place the plastic on top of the hot water glass. Turn the glass upside down, place it on top of the cold water glass, then carefully remove the plastic. Hot water is less dense than cold water, so it ""floats"" on top of the cold water.

8. Leidenfrost effect:

You need a pan, water and a stove. Turn the heat on high for about 4 minutes then add the water. This experiment can stain your pans.

9. Reverse Illusion:

Add all sorts of images or words behind a glass, then watch as it reverses when you add water in the glass.

10. Reversing Liquid:

You need 1 big glass, 1 smaller glass, 3 mixing glasses, corn syrup, pipettes, food coloring, and clips.

First pour the corn syrup into the 2 bigger glasses. Place the smaller glass inside of the bigger glass. Attach the clips to prevent the smaller glass from moving side to side in the bigger glass. Pour a small amount of corn syrup into the 3 mixing glasses. Add food coloring and stir. Fill each pipette with a different color, then add the colored corn syrup to your big glass. Turn the smaller glass carefully and watch the colors mix. Turn it back and watch them unmix.

We all want to have a good stable relationship with somebody, says Dr. Helen Fisher. So it's important to understand how intense romantic love affects our long-term goals.  Fisher's latest book is ""Anatomy of Love: A Natural History of Mating, Marriage, and Why We Stray""  (http://goo.gl/aRST8n).

Transcript - We all want to have a good stable relationship with somebody and one of the problems with early stage intense feelings of romantic love is that it‚Äôs part of the oldest parts of the brain that become activated. Brain regions linked with drive, with craving, with obsession, with motivation. And in fact some cognitive regions up I the prefrontal cortex that have evolved much more recently begin to shut down. Brain regions linked with decision making, planning ahead, you know, people who are madly in love can fall madly in love with somebody who‚Äôs married who lives on the other side of the planet, who comes from a different religion and somehow they‚Äôll say to themselves we‚Äôll work it out. We can work this out because of all that energy of intense romantic love and also the shutting down of various brain systems like with decision making. So one of the things that I say to people is, you know, before you decide to marry somebody spend some, a good deal of time with them so that some of that early stage intense feelings of romantic love can begin to subside and you can begin to really see what you‚Äôve got. As a matter of fact I‚Äôm very optimistic about the future of relationships because we‚Äôre spending so much time now getting to know somebody before we wed. You know a great many people are having these one night stands and friends with benefits and living together before they marry. And there was a recent study in which they asked a lot of single people who were living together with somebody why have they not yet married. And 67 percent were terrified of divorce, terrified of the ‚Äì not only the legal and the financial and the economic but the personal and social fallout of divorce. And so I began to realize maybe all of this hooking up and friends with benefits and living together is not recklessness. Maybe it‚Äôs caution. Maybe singles are trying to learn every single thing they can about a potential partner before they tie the knot.   Read Full Transcript Here:  http://goo.gl/poydZC",science

QHYxOl6iNb4,LA SCIENCE DE LA TAILLE DU P√âNIS,"La taille de son p√©nis, c'est un sujet qui est forc√©ment pass√© √† un moment dans la t√™te d'un adolescent. Alors qu'on le mesure avec une r√®gle, une corde ou une feuille A4, des statistiques ont √©t√© faites dans le monde sur la taille moyenne du p√©nis au niveau mondial, et surtout ce que les femmes consid√®rent comme √©tant la taille ad√©quat pour des rapports. 

Alors messieurs, on sort son double d√©cim√®tre et on est pr√©cis dans la mesure s'il vous pla√Æt !

ViZNgU-Yt-Y,9 Awesome Science Tricks Using Static Electricity!,"Add me on Facebook. (click the LIKE button on Facebook to add me) http://www.facebook.com/brusspup

All of these tricks take advantage of static electricity. In general, the lower the humidity, the better these tricks will work. The most impressive one to me is the floating bag trick. Depending on the conditions, you can float an entire grocery sack. 

1. Hover Plate: (You need Styrofoam Plates and a cloth) Styrofoam plates are great for static electricity tricks. When you give them a charge and hold one above the other, you can feel an incredible amount of resistance.

2. Can Can Go (You need a coke can, PVC pipe and a cloth) This is a classic but still fun. Try standing the can up and then tip it over with static, or try pulling 2 cans at the same time.

3. Stick Around (You need a small wooden stick, glass jar, thread, tape, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is fun because half of the time the wooden stick will come toward the pvc pipe, and other times it will move away from the pipe. When it moves away, it will stick the the side of the jar and remain there for a period of time. It also fun to use as large a jar as possible to increase the dramatic effect of the pipe moving the stick from such a large distance.

4. Bubble Trouble (You need bubble solution, plexi-glass, PVC pipe, straw and a cloth. This is a fun trick because the bubbles change their shape and move when the pvc pipe is near. It's also fun to create bubbles inside of bubbles to watch the effect of the static electricity. And also create multiple bubbles on the sheet and watch them all travel toward the pipe.

5. Dancing Balls (You need styrofoam balls, aluminum foil, plexi-glass, cloth, and an area to keep the balls from escaping. This trick is really impressive but can be a bit difficult to recreate. When the plexi-glass plate is charged and placed over the balls, they all jump up and stick to the bottom of the glass. For a few moments they travel around sporadically until they finally settle. But when you put your finger near the glass, they all start jumping around. It's also fun to use these balls with styrofoam plates / cups. If you place the ball on a charged plate, it will shoot off of the plate, or stick to it, even if the plate is held sideways or upside down.

6. Water Bender (You need a cup that you can poke a hole in,  water, PVC pipe and a cloth. This is  a classic but still fun. 

7. Balloon Fight (You need balloons, thread, PVC pipe and cloth. When the conditions are just right, the balloon can almost levitate about the pipe. But most of the time you can have fun pushing the balloons around with the charged pipe.

8. Electroscope (You need, steel wire, jar, straw, aluminum foil, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is really impressive to see in person. A really cool effect to try, which you can see in this video, is to rub the cloth on the pvc pipe from several feet away from the jar. When you run the pipe, you can see the aluminum foil pieces in the jar, moving. I was able to stand as far as 5 feet away and still see the effect.

9. Wingardium Leviosa (You need very light weight / thin plastic bags, cloth, PVC pipe) This is my favorite trick. Again, with the correct conditions, you can get the plastic pieces  to float over foot above the pipe. Produce bags from the grocery store work great. You can float an entire produce bag in the right conditions.

Have fun!",science
aPlG_w40qOE,Dr. Ron Siegel: &quot;The Science of Mindfulness&quot; | Talks at Google,"The Science of Mindfulness:
Working with Anxiety, Depression, and Other Everyday Problems

Mindfulness-based psychotherapy is the most popular new treatment approach in the last decade‚Äîand for good reason. Studies demonstrate that mindfulness practices can be effective tools to help resolve anxiety, depression, addictive habits, stress-related medical disorders, and even interpersonal conflict. Mindfulness is not, however, a one-size-fits-all remedy. We need to tailor practices to particular problems. This talk will outline how mindfulness practices work to alleviate psychological distress and how anyone can creatively adapt them to work with the difficulty of the moment.

About Dr. Siegel
Dr. Ronald D. Siegel is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychology, part time, at Harvard Medical School, where he has taught for over 30 years.

IT WAS a speech that changed the way we think of space and time. The year was 1908, and the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski had been trying to make sense of Albert Einstein‚Äôs hot new idea ‚Äì what we now know as special relativity ‚Äì describing how things shrink as they move faster and time becomes distorted. ‚ÄúHenceforth space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade into the mere shadows,‚Äù Minkowski proclaimed, ‚Äúand only a union of the two will preserve an independent reality.‚Äù

And so space-time ‚Äì the malleable fabric whose geometry can be changed by the gravity of stars, planets and matter ‚Äì was born. It is a concept that has served us well, but if physicist Petr Horava is right, it may be no more than a mirage. Horava, who is at the University of California, Berkeley, wants to rip this fabric apart and set time and space free from one another in order to come up with a unified theory that reconciles the disparate worlds of quantum mechanics and gravity ‚Äì one the most pressing challenges to modern physics.

Since Horava published his work in January 2009, it has received an astonishing amount of attention. Already, more than 250 papers have been written about it. Some researchers have started using it to explain away the twin cosmological mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. Others are finding that black holes might not behave as we thought.

OX8kEjSUr04,The Left&#39;s War on Science,"Many in the media say there‚Äôs a conservative war on science. Is this true?  No, says John Tierney,  Contributing Editor at the Manhattan Institute‚Äôs City Journal. Tierney says ‚Äúthe real war on science is the one from the left.‚Äù

John Stossel points out that people on the right are more likely to believe in creationism.

Tierney answers, ‚Äúcreationism doesn't‚Ä¶ affect the way science is done. I can't find examples where the right-wing stopped the progress of science‚Ä¶ whereas you can look on the left and you see so many areas that are taboo to research.‚Äù

Gender differences, IQ trends, genetically modified foods. Tierney says the left stifled research into what could have been a second Green Revolution to feed Africa.

People who study gender difference have leaned to keep quiet, says Tierney. ‚ÄúYou can't say that there are more men are more aggressive, more risk-taking, that status matters and making money matters more to them.‚Äù

Finally, Tierney complains that Universities are utterly dominated by leftists. In the social sciences, Democrats outnumber Republicans by at least eight to one.  In some fields like sociology it's 44 to one. Students are more likely to be taught in sociology by a Marxist [25%]  than by a Republican [2%].

Tierney says ‚Äúonce an academic department gets a majority of people who are on the left, they start hiring people like themselves, and pretty soon the whole department is that way. They start to think that their opinions and that their interests are not only the norm, but the truth.‚Äù
 
John Stossel says: think about that, next time you hear about a ""conservative war on science"".",science

yuD34tEpRFw,Time Dilation - Einstein&#39;s Theory Of Relativity Explained!,"Time dilation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity go hand in hand. Albert Einstein is the most popular physicist, as he formulated the theory of relativity, which gave the Energy mass equivalence formula and is directly related to time dilation. But what is time dilation? Time dilation and space time are interrelated. Einstein made one of the most important contributions to physics and had the concept of space time explained. A simple explanation of space time is that it is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. But it is very important to understand that the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are different. In this short animated video, we give a simple explanation of time dilation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity and also explain how time slows down in a moving vehicle!

KCxQ3hYHrZk,Science vs Cinema: THE MARTIAN,"In our pilot episode we look at the new Ridley Scott film ""THE MARTIAN"" starring Matt Damon.

How accurate was the science?  We examine every scientific subject including Getting Your Ass to Mars, Martian Weather & Gravity, Rover Technology, Mark Watney as the MacGyver of Mars, and the film's portrayal of NASA astronauts and scientists.

We went to the World Premiere of the film at the Toronto International Film Festival and talked to Director RIDLEY SCOTT, Author ANDY WEIR, Screenwriter DREW GODDARD, and stars MATT DAMON, JEFF DANIELS and MACKENZIE DAVIS.

We also visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and got their take on the film, including interviews Astronaut DREW FEUSTEL, Director of Planetary Science JIM GREEN, and Mars Researchers CARRIE BRIDGE, MATTHEW HEVERLY and KATIE STACK-MORGAN.",science

O0Uzy35uJzU,The Science of Sleep: Melatonin to Neural Pathways,"Russell Foster, Debra Skene and Stafford Lightman discuss the science of sleep. Why do we need sleep and what are the physiological processes driving our circadian rhythm? When is our circadian clock disrupted and how does this affect our health? Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs the debate.
Subscribe for regular science videos: http://bit.ly/RiSubscRibe

The science behind sleeplessness can help us understand our rhythms so we can live better and healthier lives. While hormones, such a melatonin, play a role in driving our circadian clock, the amount of sleep we get and our sleep cycles also affect our hormonal release patterns, with far-reaching implications on our health.

Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs a discussion with a panel of experts who specialise in circadian rhythms. They explore how light detection plays a role in our sleep-wake cycles, how hormone release is regulated and the implications of changes to our circadian clock and sleeplessness over time.

This event was supported by British Psychological Society and Society for Endocrinology.

Russell Foster is Professor of Circadian Neuroscience at the University of Oxford. The research interests of his group range across visual neuroscience, circadian rhythms and sleep.
You can buy his book ""The Rhythms Of Life"" now - https://geni.us/N1AjGJx

Debra Skene is Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey. She leads the research group 'Sleep, Chronobiology and Addiction' and her research focusses on links between human circadian clocks, sleep and metabolism in health, circadian disorders and metabolic diseases.

Stafford Lightman is Professor of Medicine at Bristol University. Researching the mechanisms of stress-related disease, his research has particularly looked at how neuroendocrine rhythms signal to other tissues in the body.

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

The moon is far more than just a beautiful object in the night sky.

Ever since its creation 4.5 billion years ago the moon has been edging away from Earth into space.  Throughout its journey, it has influenced our planet in different ways.  But one things clear, without it life would never have emerged on Earth.

4.5 billion years ago the moon forms when another planet slams into the early Earth.  The impact knocks our planet ‚Äúoff-balance‚Äù onto an axis of 23 degrees, which we still rotate around today.  This is what gives us our seasons.  Without it we would have no summers, springs, winters or falls.

4 billion years ago the solar system endures the most violent meteorite bombardment in its history, the Lunar Cataclysm.  The Earth, being 50 times bigger than the moon, exerts a massive gravitational pull on incoming space debris.  Because the moon is still so close to Earth it too gets hit.  99% of all craters on the lunar surface visible today are a result of this bombardment.

3 billion years ago the Earth has water and oceans.  Because the moon is far closer its gravitational pull is far stronger on the Earth.  The tides it creates are thousands of feet high and smash hundreds of miles inland every day.  Scientists believe that these tides feed the Primordial Soup with the minerals required to start life.  Without them only the most basic microbes would be on Earth today.

Today the moon has the same gravitational pull as a mosquito landing on your head, yet some people still believe it can influence our planet in bizarre ways.

The San Francisco Police Department tell us how crime appears to soar during a full moon.  But the scientific data suggests otherwise, studies show no correlation between the Full Moon and violence.  Naked Science investigates.

Scientific research into the moon is allowing some scientists to predict when natural disasters will strike.  Some researchers believe that when the sun and moon align and pull together on the Earth they can trigger both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

In the future the moon will move so far from Earth that it will affect the fine balance of our planet, sending our climate tumbling out of control.",science

O0Uzy35uJzU,The Science of Sleep: Melatonin to Neural Pathways,"Russell Foster, Debra Skene and Stafford Lightman discuss the science of sleep. Why do we need sleep and what are the physiological processes driving our circadian rhythm? When is our circadian clock disrupted and how does this affect our health? Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs the debate.
Subscribe for regular science videos: http://bit.ly/RiSubscRibe

The science behind sleeplessness can help us understand our rhythms so we can live better and healthier lives. While hormones, such a melatonin, play a role in driving our circadian clock, the amount of sleep we get and our sleep cycles also affect our hormonal release patterns, with far-reaching implications on our health.

Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs a discussion with a panel of experts who specialise in circadian rhythms. They explore how light detection plays a role in our sleep-wake cycles, how hormone release is regulated and the implications of changes to our circadian clock and sleeplessness over time.

This event was supported by British Psychological Society and Society for Endocrinology.

Russell Foster is Professor of Circadian Neuroscience at the University of Oxford. The research interests of his group range across visual neuroscience, circadian rhythms and sleep.
You can buy his book ""The Rhythms Of Life"" now - https://geni.us/N1AjGJx

Debra Skene is Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey. She leads the research group 'Sleep, Chronobiology and Addiction' and her research focusses on links between human circadian clocks, sleep and metabolism in health, circadian disorders and metabolic diseases.

Stafford Lightman is Professor of Medicine at Bristol University. Researching the mechanisms of stress-related disease, his research has particularly looked at how neuroendocrine rhythms signal to other tissues in the body.

Tzl0ELY_TiM,What is Computer Science?,"Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Vqxugd6HQ

In this part 1 video of ""What is Computer Science?"" I cover programming and discrete math in some detail.

Computer science is often thought of as just glorified programming. But once you enter undergrad you will realize this is not the entire story. Computer science has more to it including discrete math, algorithms, theory of computation, hardware programming, and more. If you just want to learn how to program, then the computer science major will be more than you are expecting.

In this video I mostly cover discrete math and concepts within it because of how important it is for classes to come. Although it's not used in all your classes, I show you examples so you have an idea of what math you will encounter.

mJ4Ngqj5wO0,Naked Science - Loch Ness,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Naked Science investigates the truth behind the legend.

The legend of the Loch Ness monster dates back 1500 years.  Since then, 1000 eye witnesses, countless photographs, sonar records and films have testified to the existence of a Loch Ness monster.  Yet despite extensive exploration, observation and scientific analysis, still no real evidence has been discovered.

This documentary starts off charting the early history of the legend.  From the first sighting by St Columba in 565AD, to the ‚ÄòSpicer‚Äô sighting that kicked off the modern legend in 1933 and the world famous ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô from 1934 that captured what appeared to be a head and neck emerging from Loch Ness.  From the ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô, the press, frenzied public and scientific observers soon concluded that the creature living in the loch was a long-extinct dinosaur called a plesiosaur.  A preposterous suggestion it would seem.  However Naked Science profiles the coelacanth.  A fish thought to be extinct 80 million years ago but discovered in 1938, to much surprise, living off the coast of Madagascar.

But even if it was a dinosaur from the Triassic period, how on earth did it get into the loch?   Loch Ness was gouged into today‚Äôs U shape valley by a series of glaciers that last melted 11,000 years ago, long after the extinction of the dinosaurs.  Naked Science profiles the geology of the loch and examines whether the sea has ever intruded into the loch perhaps carrying an unknown creature in with it.

After decades of intense observation of the surface of the loch by volunteer monster-hunters from around the world, in the late 60s Adrian Shine, skeptic, naturalist and leader of the Loch Ness Project arrived on the scene.  He took a different tactic.  Rather than search for a big monster, he looked for creatures just 100th of an inch in diameter, zooplankton.  A monster brood hiding out in the loch would need plenty of zooplankton, to support plenty of fish, who in turn could support large creatures.  Naked Science examines this ecology for clues.  We also discover there are internal waves called seiches, mirages, local wildlife, large fish such as sturgeon, floating logs, boat wakes and strong winds that could all have their place in provoking monster sightings.

But what of all the photographic evidence?  The most famous moving image of the Loch Ness monster is the so-called Dinsdale film of 1960.  At the time Britain‚Äôs foremost photographic analysis experts concluded it was an animate creature.  Using high spec imagery analysis we show how the famous Dinsdale film was most probably a helmsman in a boat.  Likewise we demonstrate that the McNab photo of 1955 could also be a boat wake.  Naked Science reveals that the notorious ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô was actually a hoax.  We show how in 1933 big game-hunter Marmaduke Wetherell planted some footprints on the loch side and passed them off as the monster.  Humiliated when his first hoax was discovered, Wetherell‚Äôs revenge was the ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô.  In a reconstruction, we show how easy it was for him to fabricate a monster from a toy submarine and reveal how the hoax remained a secret for 50 years.  Finally we look at the most unique theory by Italian geologist Dr Piccardi, that earth tremors along the Great Glen fault provoke water disturbance that are mistaken for monsters thrashing around in the water.",science

FnMCIrKRkQM,Naked Science - Pyramids,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

For over four and a half thousand years the pyramids of Egypt have stood as wonders of the world.  The facts are astonishing, the Great Pyramid alone weighs almost six million tons and contains over 2.3 million stone blocks.  Naked Science sets out to uncover four great mysteries that still surround the pyramids, how were they built, who built them, why were they built, and what secrets may still lie hidden within their stones.  As four millennia and countless generations stand between us and the men who built the pyramids we have to study the buildings themselves to uncover the answers. 

With British engineer Denys Stocks we learn the art of pyramid building.  Stocks has spent twenty years mastering the techniques used by the ancient workmen and shows how such vast quantities of stone were quarried, transported and fitted by a civilisation that had not even invented the wheel.  To show the scale of the achievement we asked construction manager and pyramid scholar Craig Smith to calculate what it would take to build a pyramid in today‚Äôs money.

We may know the names of the pharaohs who commissioned the pyramids but who actually hauled the blocks.  Legends have always held that slaves built the pyramids but we venture into the science of Forensic Egyptology to discover the truth.  Mark Lehner discovered the town of the pyramid builders while Zahi Hawass takes us on a tour of their tombs.

There may be few records of how the pyramids were built but hieroglyphic texts within some pyramids hint at their reveal purpose.  Salima Ikram and Jim Allen help us find for the reason why the pyramids were built within these spells and incantations.  However Robert Bauval, believes there may be deep connections between the pyramids and astronomy.  He believes links to the stars are hidden within their stones and chambers.

Finally we follow work in pyramid exploration as teams hunt for hidden chambers and use robots to explore the mysterious shafts at the centre of the Great Pyramid of Giza.",science

APZCfmgzoS0,Fasting vs. Eating Less: What&#39;s the Difference? (Science of Fasting),"This is about the drastic physiological differences between fasting and eating less

‚ñ≤Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/WILearned
‚ñ≤Twitter: https://twitter.com/jeverettlearned

*NOTE* One of the key things in being able to fast in a healthy matter is entering the state of ketosis - that is, switching your metabolism from burning carbohydrate to burning fat. *Considering most people have been burning carbohydrate their whole lives* this can make fasting a challenge. Upton Sinclair recommends doing quite long fasts - 12 days, but you may want to work your way up to longer fasts. Unless you are relatively keto adapted (or have experience with fasting of course), it's important that you take precautions while doing a fast. Fasting isn't inherently dangerous, *but diving into fasting when your body is in no way geared for it can be.*  I recommend doing more research before doing longer fasts. ""The Complete Guide to Fasting"" (http://amzn.to/2tQjxXa) is a good book to start with. 
As Tim Ferriss puts it: Please don't do anything stupid and kill yourself. It would make us both quite unhappy.

Just in case I should also say that  of course you need to balance fasting with eating - You need to survive off of something. I have been doing intermittent fasting the past year (22 hours fasted, 2 hours eating - you can widen it to 16/8, which still provides great benefits) and will fast for a couple days every other month or so. Several other people have recommend a routine like this - Tim Ferriss recommends doing a 3 day fast once per month and a 7 day fast once per year. 
Also make sure you're getting enough fat, protein, micronutrients and fiber to maintain a healthy weight and healthy body - *excessive* fasting can be very dangerous. 

Books Mentioned:
""The Obesity Code"" by Dr. Jason Fung - http://amzn.to/2rXtalh
""The Fasting Cure"" by Upton Sinclair - (If you google the title you can find the full book online)
""Tools of Titans"" by Tim Ferriss - http://amzn.to/2rX6P7E


[BLINKIST] Blinkist is an app I've been using lately to discover new books and review the ones I've already read. It gives you the key points in text or audio form from tons of different non-fiction books. Since I'm always going through so many books to get these done, it's very useful to get me exposed to more concepts beforehand to know if it's worth my time to buy and read through that particular book.

KCxQ3hYHrZk,Science vs Cinema: THE MARTIAN,"In our pilot episode we look at the new Ridley Scott film ""THE MARTIAN"" starring Matt Damon.

How accurate was the science?  We examine every scientific subject including Getting Your Ass to Mars, Martian Weather & Gravity, Rover Technology, Mark Watney as the MacGyver of Mars, and the film's portrayal of NASA astronauts and scientists.

We went to the World Premiere of the film at the Toronto International Film Festival and talked to Director RIDLEY SCOTT, Author ANDY WEIR, Screenwriter DREW GODDARD, and stars MATT DAMON, JEFF DANIELS and MACKENZIE DAVIS.

We also visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and got their take on the film, including interviews Astronaut DREW FEUSTEL, Director of Planetary Science JIM GREEN, and Mars Researchers CARRIE BRIDGE, MATTHEW HEVERLY and KATIE STACK-MORGAN.",science

Elizabeth Stokoe is a British scientist. She studies conversation analysis. She is a professor at Loughborough University. She graduated from the University of Central Lancashire (Preston Poly) in 1993 with a traditional psychology degree. Then Stokoe completed three years PhD research at Nene College (Leicester University) with Dr. Eunice Fisher.

Her research included videotaping interaction in university tutorials, and conducting conversation analyses of topic production, topic management, academic identity, and the relevance of gender. She developed these and other interests while working at the Institute of Behavioural Sciences (University of Derby, 1997-2000) and University College Worcester (2000-2002).

Stokoe joined the Department of Social Sciences at Loughborough in October 2002 and was promoted to Reader (2007) and Chair (2009). She teaches on the BSc Social Psychology programme, covering modules in relationships, qualitative methods and forensic psychology.

Stokoe developed the Conversation Analytic Role-play Method (CARM), an approach based on evidence about what sorts of problems and roadblocks can occur in conversation, as well as the techniques and strategies that best resolve these problems.[2] CARM won Loughborough University's Social Enterprise award (2013).

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

bOuEJf8Dr_4,25 Chemistry Experiments in 15 Minutes | Andrew Szydlo | TEDxNewcastle,"Whacky colour changes, magic disappearing water, blowing up dustbins, clouds of steam, thunder air explosions. Are you ready to fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ‚Äòexplosive‚Äô journey?

In his talk, Andrew aims to promote chemistry as the science of remarkable changes, which are often overlooked yet so important in our everyday life. And he does it brilliantly by performing an incredible series of 25 experiments in 15 minutes, totally amazing the audience (who rewards him with a long and deserved standing ovation)!

 Andrew Z. Szyd≈Ço is an internationally acclaimed chemistry teacher. But he‚Äôs definitely not the typical chemistry teacher you would expect‚Ä¶

He holds a PhD in the History and Philosophy of Science from UCL, and is an expert on the history of alchemy (his 1994 book ‚ÄòWater Which Does Not Wet Hands‚Äô is considered to be the standard reference work on the Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius.)

But his polymath spirit extends further: he‚Äôs a violin, bugle and accordion player, as well as a professional photographer. Throughout the years Andrew has wowed audiences all around the world with his pyrotechnical approach to teaching and demonstrating chemical sciences on stage and has appeared many times on TV. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",science

FqauNqFwt5I,Naked Science - Atlantis,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

A disaster is looming.  A fabulous city, rich in culture, and technological advances, is about to be destroyed.  Buildings, people, an entire civilisation, swept away by an overwhelming natural disaster.  The legend has entranced scientists and scholars for centuries.

In this episode Naked Science goes in search of the most enduring myth of all - The City of Atlantis - lost beneath the waves to a massive natural cataclysm some 11,000 years ago.  We know very little of Atlantis, in fact were it not for the writings of the Greek philosopher Plato we might not have encountered it at all.  Plato, recounting a story he heard as a child, described a huge metropolis, rich in fine art, architecture and culture.  The city was destroyed in the space of a day and a night, sunk beneath the waves for eternity by a massive natural cataclysm.  For thousands of years the tale remained an obscure yet tantalising fable until an American by the name of Ignatius Donnelly reignited the idea, bringing it to worldwide attention and sending archaeologists and trophy hunters alike across the globe in its wake.",science

Between you and the rest of the world lies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ in your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to 1.7 square metres of ground. But besides keeping your organs in, what is its purpose? Emma Bryce takes us into the integumentary system to find out.

E4katnfHzXA,I Love Nutritional Science: Dr. Joel Fuhrman at TEDxCharlottesville 2013,"Joel Fuhrman, M.D., is a board-certified family physician, NYew York Times best-selling author and nutritional researcher who specializes in preventing and reversing disease through nutritional and natural methods. He is an internationally recognized expert on nutrition and natural healing, and has appeared on hundreds of radio and television shows including The Dr. Oz Show, the Today Show, Good Morning America, and Live with Kelly. Fuhrman's own hugely successful PBS television shows, 3 Steps to Incredible Health! and Fuhrman's Immunity Solution! bring nutritional science to homes all across America.

 

As a former world class figure skater, Fuhrman placed second in the United States National Pairs Championships in 1973 and third in the 1976 World Professional Pairs Skating Championship in Jaca, Spain. Today, he is an active participant in multiple sports and is a health and fitness enthusiast. His dedication to sports medicine, foot and body alignment, injury prevention, and human performance and longevity speaks to these lifelong interests. Along with his nutritional expertise, Fuhrman has been involved professionally with sports medical committees, advised professional and Olympic athletes, and has lectured to athletic trainers and world-class athletes for maximizing performance and preventing injury.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)

0XS0j1Gtobw,The Best Science-Based Forearm Workout for Size and Strength,"When it comes to growing big forearms and improving your grip strength, you need to consider the anatomy of the forearms in order to determine what the ‚Äúbest forearm workout‚Äù might be. In this video I‚Äôll show you guys the best forearm exercises combined into a forearm workout to help boost your forearm size as well as your forearm strength (grip strength). This can be used as a forearm workout for mass but is also considered a grip strength workout given the inclusion of the suitcase holds and wrist rollers. 

If you guys enjoyed the video then don‚Äôt forget to give it a like, leave a comment, share it with your friends and subscribe to my channel. I really appreciate the support you‚Äôve all shown me, it helps motivate me to continue doing this and putting out quality videos.

jZOKljH6pBk,The Science of Reincarnation,"In the West, it's commonly assumed that reincarnation is just a ""nice thought,"" or a faith-based belief with no real evidence to support it. But there is actually a substantial body of evidence to support the idea of reincarnation, and though it has remained on the fringes of mainstream scientific thought, it promises to overthrow a number of common assumptions about consciousness and the nature of the human mind.

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:9

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:17

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: Romans 8 

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Ephesians 2

x6pYAiRqhio,Spirit Science 13 ~ The Crystal Movie,"We've created crystal infused Chakra clothes, just for you! Raise your vibration with Spirit Shirts today! https://spiritsciencecentral.com/spiritshirts

To understand how crystals work, it‚Äôs important to embody the understanding that everything is fundamentally one energy, everything vibrates together in a great unified quantum field. 

This comes up within almost every episode because it relates to literally everything in existence. 

Seeing that everything can be seen as an extension of ourselves, crystals are exactly that. They are conductors, transmuters and channelers of energy. 

Each one has their own geometric lattice, and thus, their own particular radiant energy.

fgQLyqWaCbA,Can Science Explain the Origin of Life?,"Support Stated Clearly on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/statedclearly

Darwin's theory of biological evolution helps us understand how simple life forms can give rise to complex lifeforms, but how did the first reproducing creatures come about? The origin of life needs its own explanation.

Scientists don't currently have a complete explanation for life's origins, but different labs around the globe are looking into the idea that life may have emerged from chemistry. In this animation you will learn why they are studying this idea, and you'll get to see a few of the fascinating things they have discovered.

Here are some links for further learning (organized by topic):

Lyrics

Making science! Making science!
Is so fine!
She's awake now...
...and won't the subjects be surprised!
She's awake again!
Making science! Making science!
MAKING SCIENCE!?
I'll build a turret with a gun...
...we'll shoot at you and make you run!
Oh my god! What have I done!?
It's time for testing!
Making science! Making science!
Cubes and lasers,placed in chambers...
...ready for subjects to solve the tests.
She's awake again!
Sleep mode: OFF
Now here we go...
...with all my tests we're...
...making science now!
I can't believe what's happening to me...
...I'm in control...
...of the facility!
Heheh... hurhur... uhh... that's tiring.
Won't they be impressed: I'm not a moron!
See how I change this peaceful test...
...into something that'll kill this pest!
Hmm... my compliments, from me to you!
Heh... I can't believe you actually made it through!
Now would you just stay there please!?
I'd like to introduce you to...
...huh? Nononono! DO COME BACK!
Fine, no. Don't meet him then...
...it's 'Mr. Mashy' - the spike plate.
He'd like to reduce your weight!
Ha... ha... little joke... there...
Sleep Mode: OFF
Now here we go...
...with all our guns...
...we're making science now!
Making science! Making science!
La! La! La!
It's finally here...
...and we can't wait!
So lock and load and take your aim!
'cos when the subjects start to die...
...we'll all sing out...
...""IT'S SCIENCE!""

Transcript:
The term ""bright"" I don‚Äôt much care for, but hey, we did the best we could with it.  I was with Richard Dawkins in Clearwater, Florida and a few other people who brainstormed and came up with idea of having the ""brights.""  I think I was maybe the third or fourth person to sign the membership roster.  

And a ""bright"" is someone who thinks logically and rationally; bases his or her decisions on rationality, upon logic, and upon evidence‚Äîthat‚Äôs the major thing right there.  And if we don‚Äôt have evidence, we can express our belief or lack of belief in it, but it has to be provisional.  I believe that this is probably true, though I don‚Äôt have any evidence for or against.  It‚Äôs a perfectly safe statement.  And so, brights base all of their decisions and their beliefs on logic, rationality, and evidence.  That‚Äôs the thing in which they differ from the average person who takes anything that comes along that looks attractive.  ‚ÄúOh, I like that; I think I‚Äôll believe in it.‚Äù

As the scientific picture of the universe gets weirder, could any religious claims ever be verified?

Not that I know.  I am an atheist, tried and true.  I have been since I was, oh I guess about this tall.  I‚Äôm only about this tall now.  And I made up my mind that I was going to investigate all of these things and question them.  I went to Sunday school.  I was tossed out of Sunday school immediately.  But it gave me 25 cents that I could have put in the contribution plate there, so when they pass the plate around, and I found out that at Purdy's Drug Store, you could buy a two-flavored ice cream sundae for 25 cents.  And that was a great discovery of my childhood, I must say, and I took full advantage of it.  My parents, bless them, never found out and I went off every Sunday morning as if going to Sunday school, but I lied.  And I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it now, and if my dad and mom are up there someplace, or down there someplace, I have no idea, I ask them to forgive me.",science

dFT2IKmwyfg,Intermittent Fasting &amp; Hunger - What the Science says,"The Science behind what is really making you hungry when you're fasting. 
‚ñ≤Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/WILearned
‚ñ≤Twitter: https://twitter.com/jeverettlearned 

This video will explain why hunger won't get worse and worse while fasting and why keeping your blood glucose and insulin low & why trying a keto diet will help you adapt to fasting a lot easier. 

When I first started doing intermittent fasting, handling the hunger was quite difficult. I tried several things to try and make myself less hungry without breaking the fast, but what was most helpful was knowing that it would go away on its own, and why this was the case. So, I hope that this video helps those of you trying out prolonged or intermittent fasting - hunger is pretty much inescapable, there is going to be some level of discomfort when trying out fasting, but it's very encouraging to know that things will change and hunger will naturally go away. 

Sections:
0:59 - Why hunger is rhythmic & doesn't just get stronger over time
3:13 - Why low Salt may be cause of your hunger while fasting
5:00 - How Insulin works
5:36 - How Glucagon works
6:10 - Insulin Makes you Hungry, Glucagon doesn't
7:51 - Ketones/Ketosis & Hunger
9:27 - Why you shouldn't go overboard on protein

XYHe5wQeA28,Naked Science - Birth of the Earth,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

How did the Earth evolve to support life.

Our planet now supports a huge diversity of living creatures requiring very special conditions, but what was the series of events that brought this unique set of conditions together?  What did it take to make a world that would support human life?  Naked Science takes an imaginary ‚Äòhuman‚Äô time traveller on a journey back to the moment of formation of our solar system.  We meet the scientists who are carrying out their own detective work, uncovering the clues around the world today into what our planet was like 4 and a half billion years ago.

Our journey begins with the astonishing story of how a giant cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed to form the sun and planets.  We discover that the intense heat of the early Earth created a molten iron core.  This generated a magnetic shield around our planet that protects us, to this day, from the sun‚Äôs deadliest particles. 

Many of the features we take for granted on our living planet were forged in the most violent event in our planet‚Äôs history.  Early in its life, the Earth collided with another planet.  Planetary Scientist Robin Canup has modelled the impact using supercomputers.  She reveals that the resulting fireball was so energetic it melted the Earth and created the moon.  This dramatic impact gave us our tides and seasons.

We wouldn‚Äôt have life today without water.  But where our water came from is a mystery that has long puzzled scientists.  At a NASA research laboratory, Michael Zolensky studies a recently discovered meteorite that supports the view that water came from space.

For the first half of its history the Earth had an atmosphere of methane and carbon dioxide we would find impossible to breathe.  One clue as to how the earth acquired its oxygen can be found in Australia.  Shark Bay in Western Australia is home to strange bacterial mounds called stromatolites.  The bacteria in these objects are pumping out oxygen.  A few hundred miles away geologist Martin Van Kranendonk shows us a fossil stromatolite, the world‚Äôs oldest fossil.  The evidence suggests that these strange objects are responsible for creating the air we breathe.",science

Thanks to Guilherme (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKjl-xepqcSTkJGR9pq_vQ) for taking us around Brazil. #Bel√©m #BrazilianFood #streetfood

BEL√âM, BRAZIL - What an amazing city for food lovers - so many unique dishes, foods, ingredients from the Amazon, and so many amazingly friendly and hospitable people. This was one of the best days of my trip to Brazil. 

Ver-o-peso Market - One this Amazonian street food tour of Belem, we started at the market, one of the must visit attractions in the city. It‚Äôs all you could want in an Amazon market - full of freshwater fish, herbs, vegetables, and fruits out of control.

Jambu Cacha√ßa - After walking around the fish market section and seeing some of the amazingly brightly colored chilies, I was introduced to Jambu Cacha√ßa, Brazil‚Äôs sugarcane liquor spiced up seriously with jambu - an Amazon tongue numbing flower and leaves. Wow, it‚Äôs serious.

Beef soup - 6 BRL ($.155) - We stopped an a friendly man selling Brazil nuts, and right then, a lady came around selling soups for breakfast. We had a beef soup, very hearty and delicious. I tried the jambu flower for the first time, so strong and so good. We then ate some Brazil nuts, a superfood packed with nutrition.

Fruit juice - There‚Äôs nothing like Amazon fruits and here‚Äôs the juices we tried: Cupua√ßu, Cacao, Bacuri, Acerola

Box da Eliana e Kelly - And here‚Äôs where this Amazon street food tour in Brazil got out of control. Our friends in Belem had organised with Eliana, from Box da Eliana e Kelly to host us for an amazing Amazon food lunch, where all their friends at the market each cooked their speciality and brought it to the table. There was so much good food and so much love I could hardly believe it. Lots of the Belem Amazon foods contained tucupi (sauce from wild manioc), jambu flowers and leaves, and Pirarucu fish.

Thank you Eliana! None of the amazing Ladies would accept payment. Please go meet them in Bel√©m!

Tacac√° Da Diva - 4 pm is the best time in Belem to eat one of the most amazing street food in the city, and I would say one of the best street foods in Brazil - Tacac√°, I still can‚Äôt believe how good it is, and how it‚Äôs not loved all over the world! We also had Vatap√°. Price - 13 BRL ($3.35) per bowl

Ros√°rio Lanches - Finally to finish this Amazon street food tour of Belem, Brazil, we went to Ros√°rio Lanches, a legendary stall. We tried both their roasted pork let and their hot dog, both of which were incredibly delicious.

What am unforgettable day of Amazonian food in Bel√©m, Brazil. Thank you to everyone who made it happen and to everyone for preparing the amazing food.

Im2gVWc2-hU,TURKISH STREET FOOD : You&#39;ve NEVER Seen this Before!!! KEBAB HEAVEN + Street Food in Izmir Turkey,"Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar Street Food tour in IZMIR, TURKEY

Welcome to the first episode of our Turkey street food series. historical KEMERALTI BAZAAR (Tarihi Kemeraltƒ± √áar≈üƒ±sƒ±)!

We start our street food tour at a famous ‚Äúb√∂rek√ßisi‚Äù for some savoury b√∂rek pastries. We ordered our b√∂rek with pastirma and cheese. It was very delicious and fun to watch the chef prepare the dish! (17 TRY / 2.92 USD)

Continuing through the ancient 7th century market, we find an extremely unique shop serving up an Izmir speciality Tur≈°u Suyu, which is pickle juice! Made up of simple ingredients to be sour, spicy and extremely refreshing. Pickle juice is best enjoyed in Izmir in the summer heat! (3 TRY / 0.52 USD)

For lunch, we try manisa kebap, hailing from the city of Manisa which is right outside of Izmir. The dish consists of kebab chunks, served on top of flatbread with a side of tomato sauce and yogurt. It is also covered in rich butter. So mouthwatering and very CHEAP! (32 TRY / 5.50 USD with unlimited tea)

Just outside of the market is the Izmir Clock Tower. It is considered the symbol of Izmir and shouldn‚Äôt be missed while you‚Äôre in the city. It is a great place to take in the views of the sea. 

We were craving something sweet and went back into the market for shambli, a semolina cake soaked in syrup, mixed with walnuts, filled with cream, and some are covered in crushed pistachio. This will give you a sugar HIGH! (regular 5 TRY / 0.86 USD + pistachio 6 TRY / 1.03 USD)

To wash it all down, Turkish coffee is like no other coffee in the world and many shops have their own unique way of making it. Turkish coffee is always unfiltered so expect it to be strong and full of silt. (7 TRY / 1.20 USD)

We made a quick stop for ‚Äúmacun‚Äù which is an Ottoman candy. It is made in the most traditional way and these vendors do not have 1 location.  (4 TRY / 0.69 USD)

For our final stop of the day, we had to eat some seafood because Izmir is quite famous for it‚Äôs fresh fish! We chose a midye dolma (translation: STUFFED MUSSELS) restaurant. These mussels are stuffed with spiced rice and locals squeeze lemon directly onto each and every mussel.These were the FRESHEST mussels we‚Äôve tried in all of Turkey! (14 TRY / 2.41 USD for half kilo)

Mombasa is a beautiful city located in Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. It‚Äôs a melting pot of a city, full of culture and delicious food. In this video, I met up with Farhana and Samil, both from Mombasa, and both love to eat.

Lighthouse - First place we headed on this Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa is along the coast called Mama Ngina drive, or Lighthouse. You‚Äôll find an abundance of small snacks along the road with a view over the cliffs of the Indian ocean. Probably my favorite street food was the fried cassava chips, which are fried fresh, put into bags, then seasoned with salt, chili powder, and lime juice.

Here are the main street food snacks we had:
Coconut, heart of palm, cassava - 340 KES ($3.33) total
Cassava chips
Roasted and fried cassava
Coconuts
Sweet potato, corn, many things

Next we headed into the heart of Mombasa to eat from a roadside shop selling a mixture of bhajias, fried potatoes, and fried chilies. This is legendary street food in Mombasa! When you order she puts all the fried things onto a plate and douses them in coconut chutney and hot sauce. The combination is delicious, and  my favorite item was the fried chilies.
Bhajia plate combo - 90 KES ($0.88)

Azad Ice Cream - We then had sugarcane juice, a Mombasa Kenyan favorite. They added sugarcane, plus ginger and lime.

Damascus Shawarma - 200 KES ($1.96) - One of the popular food trucks in Mombasa is Damascus shawarma. It was pretty good.

Abbasi Darbar - To finish off this Kenyan food tour of Mombasa, we ended with a  mega meat feast at Abbasi Darbar, a great place to fulfill all your meat needs. We ordered most of what they offer on the menu. Everything was delicious,  but I think the winner for me was the spring chicken tikka.
Total price - 1,900 KES ($18.64)

Again, thank you for Farhana for taking me on this amazing Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa, Kenya. Be sure to check out her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCruHCa93z0-aV1DjdYtlPXQ

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now travel vlogging is our full-time gig, and we feel like we have the greatest job in the world! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)

We‚Äôve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube‚Äôs algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",food

Karachi street food is VERY delicious and famous for food lovers! In this street food video, I'm starting out by exploring burns road and finding a famous Chicken chargha, WHOLE chicken coated in masala and spice and deep fried in the richest, darkest oil. I bought a whole chicken and packed it up in a bag and kept exploring the deep back alleys near burns road for more famous Pakistani street food.

After this, I found an alleyway selling thousands and thousands of unique street foods, right off of Burns road in Karachi. I stopped at the first and most busiest stall I saw, selling famous Pakistani pakoras, samosas, jalebi desserts, and more. I ordered a few of the best street foods I saw and tried to pay but no one would accept my payment! 

Then, we're meeting up with my friends Shehroze and Alizeh to break the fast for the Iftar for Ramzan (Ramadan). We found a local restaurant and brought all the food in and purchased some extra street food and started eating!

The next day, Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing us to a very local style place to break the fast with all the locals, right under a bridge!

FGe3KhkNxss,"Mouthwatering INDIAN STREET FOOD Breakfast Tour - Puri, Sabji &amp; Raj Kachori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They‚Äôre so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi‚Äôs scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn‚Äôt have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn‚Äôt small, but at the same time, it wasn‚Äôt huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I‚Äôd never had it before. It‚Äôs a big, crunchy kachori that‚Äôs stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It‚Äôs an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn‚Äôt contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn‚Äôt wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it‚Äôs a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don‚Äôt miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

On Day 27 in Lisbon, Portugal, I made up my mind to eat as much Portuguese food and at some of the best local restaurants in Lisbon. It turned out to be a fantastic day in Lisbon with some seriously good Portuguese food!

00:36 Cafe Martinho Da Arcada at Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio - The first place we stopped in the morning is a legendary cafe in Lisbon that is the oldest cafe in Lisbon called Cafe Martinho Da Arcada. The main reason I wanted to go there was to try their past√©is de bacalhau, classic Portuguese food codfish fritters. The coffee and ambience and of the cafe was also nice. Total price - 9.30 EUR

Restaurante Z√© da Mouraria (I think it was closed for holidays) - I really wanted to eat at this restaurant during my visit to Lisbon, but unfortunately they were closed for holidays, so if you go to Lisbon and are looking for local Portuguese food, check this place out.

5:32 Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz - For our next meal, although not Portuguese food, but more Mozambican food, we headed over to Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz. The food was remarkable, one of the best meals I had in Lisbon. I first began with some beef samosas which were insanely good, and then had spicy bakra piri piri, spicy lamb ribs. Total price - 35.00 EUR

11:14 Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco - Finally, to try some authentic Portuguese food in Lisbon, we headed over to a restaurant called Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco. This small family run restaurant serves delicious Portuguese food and many of the classics. I ordered bacalhau com gr√£o, codfish with garbanzo beans and carne de porco √† alentejana, pork with clams. Along with the delicious local food, what I loved was the ambiance and feel of the restaurant. Total price - 20.15 EUR

22:10 Ocean√°rio de Lisboa (Entrance price - 17 EUR per person) - By this point on this Portuguese food tour of Lisbon, I was feeling pretty full, so we headed over to Ocean√°rio de Lisboa and walked around one of Europe‚Äôs biggest aquariums.

24:22 Cafe on Avenida da Liberdade (Coffee - 1.40 EUR) - One of the things I love about Lisbon is the social cafe culture and atmosphere. In the afternoon I was starting to feel pretty sleepy, so before dinner, I had a cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe along Avenida.

25:12 Solar dos Presuntos - For the last Portuguese meal in on this food tour of restaurants in Lisbon, I decided to eat at a restaurants called Solar dos Presuntos. I didn‚Äôt know it was going to be such a fancy high end restaurant, but it was our last night in Lisbon, so we decided to go for it. I started with the pata negra, a plate of incredibly good ham. Then I ordered the polvo √† lagareiro, some of the most tender octopus I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Finally we also ordered dourada grelhada - gilt-head sea bream fish. The food was expensive, but delicious. Total price - 60.85 EUR.

This was a fantastic day of Portuguese food in Lisbon, and many of the places we ate today were the best restaurants I tried in Lisbon.

GMPh6t-lwjM,"Indian STREET FOOD Tour at Night - Momos, Vada Pav &amp; Chicken Tandoori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

One of the things I love the most about travel is that destinations are never just one thing. They‚Äôre multi-layered and diverse. A prime example of that is India, a country I‚Äôve now visited three times. The states of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, which I explored in March of 2019, are so different from other parts of the country, from the people to the culture to the landscapes to the food. It‚Äôs so exciting to get more of a sense of what India is and I‚Äôm thrilled to share this gorgeous and unique region with you!

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

My first night in the Assamese city of Jorhat continued as my friend Rishi and I headed out on a nighttime street food tour I will never forget! Jorhat is very close to China, so there are lots of Chinese and even Mongolian influences in the cuisine there. I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste them for myself!

First, we headed to Break Time to get some momos. These momos are steamed first and then fried. A rich and spicy red sauce with pepper and chilies is made and the momos are stir-fried with it. These momos weren‚Äôt too hot and I loved the red sauce! They were the best fried momos I‚Äôd ever had. They were still crunchy on the outside and super juicy in the middle. The chicken inside was minced and perfectly cooked. They‚Äôre super filling and were like spicy, Szechwan-inspired momos. I was in love with them! You get a massive plate of them for only 60 rupees, or roughly $0.86 U.S.

Next, we headed back out and got some Vada Pav at Delhi Chaat House. Vada Pav is a potato fritter that is served on a bun with chutneys and is sometimes referred to as an Indian burger. I‚Äôd had it before in Mumbai and Pune and couldn‚Äôt wait to try it again. It was served with mustard, sweet sauce, coriander chutney, and a spicy sauce. The sweet sauce was so tasty. The bun was super fluffy and the spicy sauce was really hot! I also loved the coriander chutney. It was an amazing potato mash sandwich! It only cost about 40 rupees, or about $0.58 U.S.  

After that, we continued our street food tour by heading back out and getting some spicy chicken wings at Seev‚Äôs. They use the second spiciest peppers in the world, ghost peppers, in their wings. There was a honey glazed sauce on it that contained the peppers. The chicken wasn‚Äôt that hot but was super juicy. The heat made my lips tingle a little bit as I continued eating.

We also got some double-marinated chicken tandoori drumsticks, which had a thick, white sauce on them. I loved the smoky flavor and the glaze was so creamy and cheesy. I was in love with them! I added some mint chutney to them which was great. The sauce was like a soft brie cheese. Our total there came to 450 rupees ($6.49 U.S.): 250 ($3.60 U.S.) for the wings and 200 ($2.88 U.S.) for the tandoori drumsticks.

Next, we were back on the streets of Jorhat to get some spicy pani puri! Pani Puri is my favorite Indian dish of all time and my mouth was all set for a spicy version of it! They‚Äôre made of leavened, hollow flatbread that is filled with an aloo (potato) mixture, chilies, onions, pani (spiced water), and a spicy sauce. It was super hot and really good. I loved the crunch and chunks of potato. I‚Äôd never had pani puri this spicy! It costs 10 rupees ($0.14 U.S.) for 5 puris and the vendor keeps giving you more until you say you‚Äôre done.

The vendor also gave me a dry one without pani that I liked even better! I could honestly eat pani puri forever. The dry ones without the pani were so fantastic! I loved them so much. They were both spicy and sweet and had an incredible flavor combination. And even though it‚Äôs 10 rupees for 5, the vendor actually gives you an extra one for free!

Our final destination was Ice Station, where we got some rose lassi. I hadn‚Äôt had lassi in a while and I wanted to cool my mouth off after the spicy pani puri. It was delicious and milky and more like a shake. They put nuts on top, which add a nice crunch. I‚Äôd had a thicker lassi in Amritsar but I really liked this one, too. It had a nice rose flavor and helped me beat the fiery feeling in my mouth, so it did the trick! 

I hope you loved my nighttime street food tour of Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment. Also, please subscribe to my channel.

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2SDLtoqPZlZYgbyMI5c2A). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Glodok is the Chinatown of Jakarta, and my wife and I decided to spend the day walking around Glodok and exploring some Indonesian street food throughout the day. At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.

Since we were staying at a hotel (here‚Äôs information on the hotel I stayed at:https://migrationology.com/travel-guides/jakarta-indonesia/)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn‚Äôt take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta‚Äôs Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.

The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.

One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.

We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.

It probably wasn‚Äôt the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!

Here‚Äôs the list of the things we ate and the prices:

Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)
Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)
Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) 
Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)

Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) each
Fried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)
Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged? Do you think?

Hope you enjoyed the Indonesian street food tour of Glodok and Fatahillah Square, I sure enjoyed eating it!

Even though the city of Hyderabad is more famous for its legendary quintessential non vegetarian wonders that are evidently more conspicuous in its culinary landscape, there is absolutely no dearth of delectable native or popular vegetarian delights in the city. So in this fun filled gastronomic sojourn we braced ourselves to gorge on some delicious vegetarian street side dishes that are widely popular among  the locals. Our host, Sankalp Vishnu, a renowned food expert in the city, took us around the vibrant locality across P G Road, Sindhi colony, Secunderabad that is well known for a wide range of regional vegetarian street food offerings. Let‚Äôs get started.

Our first stop was Top and Tasty, where we tried the Indo chinese style Manchuria pav bhaji. This innovative take on the regular pav bhaji was indeed very delicious. The garlic,red chilli punch as imbibed from the manchurian style of cooking made the dish surprisingly indulgent. 

The second stop was Shivaling Chaat corner where we tried a delicious serving of Hyderabadi style matar(yellow pea) chaat. This savoury and tangy playful dish was topped with sweetened curd, sev and sweet chutney. Unlike its North Indian counterparts, this chaat was served hot. Though that didn't diminish the fun.

The third joint that we stopped by was the Chachaji food cart where we got to taste a delicious Dabeli, a popular Gujarati snack. The perfectly balanced sweet and savoury flavour of the Dabeli was beautifully complemented by the super tasty peanut chutney. It‚Äôs a must try snack if you love the sweet notes in your dish.

The fourth place where we halted was a dosa kiosk named Dosa Verito,right outside the Mayur Pan shop. It boasts of 151 varieties of dosas. After much deliberation we settled for the macaroni pasta dosa and blueberry ice cream dosa. The former one was super cheesy and irresistible while the latter one was a truly luscious fusion treat. 

Our fifth stop was Bombay chaat house where we tried the Hyderabadi version of the Mumbai special Vada Pav. The dry garlic chutney and the unusual garnish of chopped onions enhanced its taste. 

From there we went on to our sixth stop, the Famous and Live Soda where we tried their best selling item the digest soda that is essentially soda mixed with a concentrate prepared with sugar and digestive spices like cumin ,rock salt etc. It was super refreshing and appeasing. 

This delectable veg street food journey concluded with a Paan treat from the popular paan shop in the area the Dimmy‚Äôs Paan Place. Its was a perfect way to end this awesome exploration. 

We confer our heartfelt thanks to Sankalp Bhai for introducing us to the best veg street food offerings.

pBPXxO9E-fQ,West African Food - EXOTIC DELICACY in GHANA!,"‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Bushmeat is a term that is used to often describe wild game meat in Africa. And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It‚Äôs a delicacy!

So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. 

Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.

First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.

For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.

Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.

How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender. I thought it was amazing!

Across West African food, grasscutter is a very popular meat, and a delicacy eaten on special occasions.

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you‚Äôll find in this video:

Z√ºrich, Switzerland

Caf√© Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I‚Äôve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossm√ºnster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn‚Äôt realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Z√ºrcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It‚Äôs quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don‚Äôt want  to miss when you‚Äôre in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

There are few cities in the world that can compare to Jerusalem in terms of ancient history and religious significance. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it‚Äôs a city that I‚Äôve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/) and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you‚Äôll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem!
 
We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I‚Äôve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.

After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.

Here‚Äôs all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:

Hummus Acramawi
Price - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plate

Almond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)

Al-shuala Grill Restaurant

Zalatimo Sweets

Western Wall (Wailing Wall)
Western Wall Tunnel

It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.

Thank you again to David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/) and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!

YvlYjLPgrCE,Street Food in Ghana - GIANT CHOP-BAR LUNCH and West African Food Tour in Accra!,"This was an incredible day of street food in Ghana!
‚ñ∫Check out Jay: https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/
‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She‚Äôs a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she‚Äôs incredible. Check out her Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/) and YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8y8uGewOe2NAuNQALV_uaw). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here‚Äôs all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What‚Äôs key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you into Peshawar, Pakistan, for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar,  part 2! Peshawar is a famous old market town Pakistan with some of the biggest street food markets in the country. Peshawar's markets are full of delicious street food and tons of famous Pakistani cuisine. In one block, you can find SUPERHUMAN curry, Chapli Kababs AKA Chapli Kebabs,, chicken sajji, paya, and much more. Flying in to eat the street food in Pakistan is a great travel decision, and coming to Peshawar at the core is the best place in Pakistan to experience the street food scene! Peshawar has one of the richest street food scenes in the world! 

In today's street food video we're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING famous Peshawar Chapli Kababs (Kebabs), HUGE Pulao Mountains, and UNSEEN street foods like Pakistani street food scrambled eggs and superhuman curry! There's so much street food in this video, you have to watch the whole Pakistani street food vlog! We're also bringing you to some ULTRA RARE Peshawar fried fish! There's so much Pakistani street food!! 

To start out our huge Peshawar street food tour, we're bringing you to a SUPER FAST street curry vendor, the CHENNA MASTER of Peshawar! He was ULTRA speedy the way he scooped up the chenna, and here, it was UPGRADED with a big scoop of mint chutney! One of the best street foods in the world! It was full of masala and very delicious! 

After this, we're bringing you foodrangin' even more and bringing you to a couple FAMOUS street foods in Peshawar. 

The first is a local Pakistani street food that is famous all throughout the country, but best here in Peshawar, the chapli kababs (kebabs). The kebab patties were full of local spices and masala and also hundreds of fried eggs! They were really heavy but so SATISFYING!! They were definitely one of the best street foods to try in Pakistan!

After this, we're bringing you to a famous Pulao to try in Pakistan, the Kabuli Pulao, but here, at the Shinwari Kabuli Pulao in Peshawar, it is even better! The GIANT pot is loaded up with tons of basmati and beef stock, and then after it's cooked using their secret masala and local Pakistani recipe, is loaded up with the most tender and fatty beef and huge scoops of carrot and raisin! It's sweet and also very fragrant and fatty and succulent! One of the best Pulao dishes in the world! 

After tasting the Kabuli Pulao, we walked down a busy market street of Peshawar and found a famous fried fish shop! Here, huge filets of fish are fried in a dark oil and covered in a spicy masala and served with lemon. It was super soft and juicy fish meat! 

After this, we found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the 5 egg scramble with LIVER!  It was loaded with tomato and green chili and huge chunks of liver! It was quite spicy and very oily but also very satisfying!

After this, to finish off the day, we went right across the street from the 5 egg Pakistani style to try a local curry shop. Here, it was SUPERHUMAN curry because the flavours were some of the BEST in the world, SUPER DELICIOUS!

Chinese Street Food Shanghai - Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
Chinese street food and Chinese Food in China is incredibly delicious! So I flew to Shanghai, China and have been eating street food, noodles, and dumplings non-stop. Best Street Food to try! The Chinese food is so good in Shanghai! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Chengdu, street food in Xi‚Äôan, street food in Guangzhou, and now, street food in Shanghai. A lot of the street food in Shanghai is similar to other street food in China. You can find some unique Shanghai street food specialties here, like xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), shengjianbao (pan fried dumplings), seafood on the street, and some delicious noodles as well. You can also enjoy countless other street foods in Shanghai, many featured in this video.

One also gets to witness the luxurious seaside resort and it's magnificent one bedroom ocean view suite in my action packed video.

JW Marriott Resort is spread across thirty acres and has a private beach, three swimming pools, twelve restaurants and two hundred and fifty plus rooms.

Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5) has long been one of my go-to street food streets in Bangkok. Starting in the evening at around 4 pm, the entire road starts to fill with street food carts selling all sorts of Thai dishes. You‚Äôll find everything from rice and curry to soup noodles, snacks, and fresh fruits and vegetables. It had been a few years since I had explore Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5), so in this Thai street food tour I‚Äôm taking you with me to some of my old favorites, and some new spots. Enjoy!

Yam mama (‡∏¢‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏°‡πà‡∏≤) - 50 THB ($1.52) - This is the first dish I tried. MAMA are Thai instant noodles and this is a completely different way to eat them - in mixed salad form.

Khanom krok (‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏Å) - 30 THB ($0.92) - Coconut griddle cakes are one of my favorites, they are crunchy on the outside and gooey in the center. Don‚Äôt miss this Thai street food snack.

Cha yen (‡∏ä‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏¢‡πá‡∏ô) - 25 THB ($0.76) per cup - Thai tea

Pad thai (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢), Hoy tod (‡∏´‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏î) - This was formerly a street food cart that now has their own permanent shophouse location. They make pretty decent Pad Thai and they hoy tod, which in this case in a mussels omelet, is pretty good as well.
Total price - 125 THB ($3.81)

Nam prik pla too (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏û‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏π) - For something a little healthier, I‚Äôm a huge fan of nam pirk pla too, a pounded chili mackerel sauce that‚Äôs eaten with vegetables.
Total price - 70 THB ($2.14) for everything

Chao guay (‡πÄ‡∏â‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢) - 25 THB ($0.76) - For dessert, I had grass jelly with ice. The owner was so friendly and happy.

Haircut - 100 THB ($3.05)

Pad kra prao moo krob kai dao (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏Ç‡πà‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ß) - Final meal of this Bangkok street food tour, I headed across the street to Petchaburi Soi 10 to seek out one of my old time favorites. The stall was still there, and they make a pretty good plate of Thai crispy pork belly fried with basil.
Price - 40 THB ($1.22)

Thank you for joining me on this Thai street food tour of Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5). It‚Äôs the type of street you can walk through and just choose whatever you like to eat.

_QchW8YGUrw,RAMZAN SPECIAL !!! Turmeric GOAT BIRYANI Prepared By my daddy ARUMUGAM / Village food factory,"Village food factory

#Happyramzan",food
OyxWVJQUC18,World Famous Hyderabadi CHICKEN BIRYANI | Biryani MAKING &amp; Tasting,"The Hyderabadi Biryani needs no detailed introduction. This glorious delicacy is a staple for the locals and the go-to dish for the tourists. Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct from its popular counterparts because of its distinct aroma, taste, texture and the mode of preparation.

With the essence of Turkish, Mughlai and Arabic influences in it, the Hyderabadi Biryani has been an integral part of the Hyderabad‚Äôs culinary tradition since a long time. In this culinary exploration, we have set out to savour the dazzling aura of this majestic dish at some of the most famed destinations across the city. We are happy to be accompanied by our gracious host Sankalp Vishnu who is an acclaimed food critic and food expert.

We tried Hyderabadi biryani at two eminent places-The Lucky restaurant and the Bawarchi restaurant. Our intention was to understand the nuances or fine tuning of the variations in the Hyderabadi biryani as adopted by these joints. 

Our first stop was the Lucky restaurant that serves one of the best versions of the Kachi Gost Ki Biryani. We got the opportunity to witness the making of a batch of Hyderabadi Biryani at their wonderful, aromatic kitchen. The seemingly easy procedure entails an astute understanding of the dynamics of its cooking, perseverance and dexterity. The genial owner for Lucky restaurant walked us through the process sharing all the details of their prized preparation. We then tried the Nalli Biryani along with some other delectable meaty wonders. The feast ended with the lusciously amazing Khubani ka Meetha a dessert that‚Äôs exclusive to the city.

The next day we went to the acclaimed Bawarchi restaurant to try their version of the Hyderabadi Biryani. In recent years it has emerged as favourite destination for the same. The beautifully done Chicken Biryani was worth all the reputation. It ticked all the boxes of parameters that make the magic of a biryani work. A distinct feature of the biryani here was the pleasantly notable presence of the shah jeera flavour in it. Here we also tried the Hyderabad famous Double Ka Meetha and the Kaddu ka kheer. The latter one was the best.
 
While winding up this Hyderabadi biryani trail we couldn‚Äôt but wonder at the flamboyant stature of this apparently royal dish that rules the heart of the masses in and beyond this city.

 We are truly grateful to Sankalp Vishnu for his cooperation.

a98CLEfH-_g,Machine Gun Kelly Tries Underground NOLA Food || InstaChef,"It‚Äôs a meeting of Midwestern minds as rapper and actor Machine Gun Kelly links up with Cliff to take on the underground food scene in New Orleans. We are introduced to Louisiana-style vegan food from King of Kings Plant Based Cuisine that has both Cliff and MGK rethink what it means to live on a plant-based diet. They then sample some traditional NOLA-style steak and salmon dishes from @nolatopchef that are so good Machine Gun Kelly gets violent. 

Chop it up with chef Cliff Skighwalker on our new series ‚ÄúInstaChef‚Äù! Cliff and his celebrity friends tour the country to take a deep dive into the underground food scene. There‚Äôs a network of chefs in America who are delivering food to people strictly through Instagram. Folks cook food in their house, post what they‚Äôre making on Instagram, and sell it to customers who come by. And these people aren‚Äôt trend-seeking foodies taking vanity glamour shots on Instagram, but former line cooks, restaurant workers, and home chefs taking success into their own hands to make a better life for themselves and their family. Don't believe us? Just watch as local chefs pursue their dreams, drop culinary gems, and do it all for the 'Gram!

S2UBy8bkgyE,What Japanese Prison Food is Like  ‚òÖ ONLY in JAPAN,"Japan has some amazing prison food, which should be no surprise. Inmates are served healthy, nutritious meals of grilled fish, salads, rice and soup - which are actually healthier than most school lunches around the world! Would you like to try what prisoners eat? There's a prison in Hokkaido that serves authentic meals to the public and that is where I went -- Abashiri. 

Abashiri is in the very north of Hokkaido and is famous for its prison. Their ""Bangaichi Shokudo Diner"" is the only restaurant that serves authentic prison food in Japan, the ingredients the same as the penitentiary nearby. The meals will probably surprise you! 

Prison Food Menu:
SET A: Pacific Saury, 2 salads, barley rice, miso soup (780 yen / $7.00)
SET B: Atka Mackerel, 2 salads, barley rice, miso soup (820 yen / $7.50) 

It's called the ""secret meal"" because Japanese Prisons are very restrictive with access to the outside world. However, Abashiri is dfferent and they've opened up prison life to the public and it's worth a visit. 

We also get a tour of today's prison cells in Japan. They have tatami mats, futons, TV, toilet and window. There are private cells and cells for 6 or more inmates. Japanese inmates typically eat their meals in their cells. 

The Japanese prison life is regimented, the schedule the same everyday. Wake up at 6:40am and lights out at 9:00pm. 
Meal time is three times a day for 20 minutes. 

Where is Abashiri, Japan? 
It's in Hokkaido's north, a 90 plane ride from Tokyo's Haneda Airport.

Thank you for watching this ultimate Kenyan street food tour in Nairobi! I met up with my friend James who took me around to a few of his favorite spots to eat.

Kawangware, Nairobi, Kenya

Here's most of the food we tried on this amazing tour of Nairobi:

Ann Restaurant - Dagoretti Corner - This small street food stall on Dagoretti Corner in Nairobi serves all sorts of Kenyan / East African foods. Their chapatis are especially good, and their Lake Victoria  sardines fried with tomatoes.
Chapati
Dagaa - Lake Victoria sardine
Matumbo - stomach stew
Githeri - beans and maize
The guy sitting across the table - ‚Äúyou should not eat beans and sardines together, or you‚Äôll have gas.‚Äù
Total bill - 1,050 KES ($10.39) - we paid for 4 or 5 guys eating there

Stomach Clinix -  This was  the best  food stop of the day, a neighborhood meat shop that James took me to that specializes in cow head soup. The grilled tongue was also spectacular, but the soup was the best.
Total price - 200 KES ($1.98)

Dagoretti Market -  After the meat, we took a walk over to Dagoretti Market. After browsing around for a while, we stopped for another plate of mixed Kenyan food, mostly dengu, which are mung beans. It was simple, but quite good.
Dengu - mung beans
Total price - 300 KES ($2.97)

Unity Cafe Hotel - We met up with some of James' friend in Kawangware, and went to eat across the street from their shoe shop. The mandazi mix was the highlight of this Kenyan meal.
Total price - 600 KES ($5.94) for all

Cow foot fry - Next we headed over to Oscar who makes cow food soup, fry and boil. He was a very friendly man, and showed me his entire process of making cow foot soup. It was delicious!
Total price - 450 KES ($4.45)

Kenyan street food - To end this Kenyan street food tour of Nairobi we had to eat one of the ultimate Kenyan fast food meat treats. You'll see these types of grills all over the streets in the late afternoon throughout Nairobi. You just choose what you want, it's cut on the chopping board, and you stand and eat.
Esophagus
Intestines
Mutura - minced meat sausage
Mutura - blood sausage
Udder
Total price - 200 KES ($1.97)

Thank you for watching this ultimate Nairobi street food tour!

Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours: http://www.zoubatours.com/ for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn‚Äôt eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there‚Äôs a version that‚Äôs comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I‚Äôve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ¬Ω chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours (http://www.zoubatours.com/) for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch the full series here: https://goo.gl/QhiJUb

Talad Rot Fai (‡∏ï‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏î‡∏£‡∏ñ‡πÑ‡∏ü), also known as the Train night market in Bangkok, or Talad Rot Fai in Thai, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok - this branch located at Ratchada. Here‚Äôs a map link: https://goo.gl/maps/EVKBg2ws46t

By the way, this is Part 2 of this Night Market Thai street food tour. You can watch the gigantic tom yum challenge here: https://youtu.be/4eZbr5qDxio

The market is known for its unique Thai street food, some of the snacks and dishes which are invented there and you won‚Äôt find anywhere else in Bangkok.

Laeng Saeb (‡πÄ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ã‡πà‡∏ö) at Diaw Maekhlong Restaurant (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á) - Laeng saeb, a dish of pork bones and ridiculous amounts of green chilies is one of the most popular Thai street food inventions at Talad Rot Fai, and this is mainly what I came to eat. The restaurant is located at the back of the market, and they have a few different sizes you can choose from.

XXL Laeng Saeb (‡πÄ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ã‡πà‡∏ö) - Price - 599 THB ($18.96) - We went straight for the XXL size, a massive platter of pork bones, soup, insane amounts of green chilies and the soup broth. Of all the Thai street food I‚Äôve eaten, this is one of the most unbelievable and insanely giant street foods of Thailand I‚Äôve ever seen or eaten. Although it‚Äôs way more than I ever care to eat again in one sitting, it‚Äôs actually a really good dish.

Crispy butter (‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö) - 35 THB ($1.11)
Stir fried ice cream (‡πÑ‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î) - 69 THB ($2.18)
Coconut shake (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏õ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô) - 35 THB ($1.11)

And that completed this Thai street food night market tour of Talad Rot Fai. It‚Äôs well worth a visit, and you can of course, order smaller sizes of laeng saeb when you‚Äôre in Bangkok. Enjoy!

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp 
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4 
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM 

ü¶ê Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

üí∏PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp
----
2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish 
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture 
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

üêüTakamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo‚Äôs finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN‚Äôs 2011 list of the World‚Äôs 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

8Ug1MnU6LKw,Unprocessed -- how I gave up processed foods (and why it matters) | Megan Kimble | TEDxTucsonSalon,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. n January of 2012, Megan Kimble was a city-dwelling 26-year-old‚Äîbusy and broke, living in a small apartment without so much as a garden plot to her name. But she cared about food: where it came from, how it was made, and what it did to her body. So she set herself a challenge: She would go an entire year without eating processed foods. In this talk, she discusses what makes a food processed and how those processes impact our bodies and communities.

Megan Kimble is the managing editor of Edible Baja Arizona, a local food magazine serving Tucson and the borderlands, and is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times. Her book, Unprocessed, about her year of eating only whole, unprocessed food, is forthcoming from William Morrow in 2015. Follow along at megankimble.com. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",food

In this episode, Jason and food historian Chris Carr discuss the medieval understanding of nutrition and how it affected the knight‚Äôs diet, as well as the influence of spices and how they defined one‚Äôs social standing.

OO9kSxcT9Rg,The Ultimate MEXICAN STREET FOOD TACOS Tour of Mexico City! (ft. La Ruta de la Garnacha),"‚ñ∫Subscribe to Lalo‚Äôs channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo
‚ñ∫T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Welcome to the best tacos in the world - the ultimate guide to Mexican street food tacos in Mexico City!

I met up with Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha (https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo), he‚Äôs from Mexico City, he makes videos about street food as well. And he took me to his favorite tacos in all of Mexico City. We each ate the most tacos in one single day that we‚Äôd ever eaten in our lives, and it was the greatest taco day of my life!

Here are all the places we ate in this video:

Tacos Joven - They are known for their tacos de canasta, which are basket tacos, famous in Mexico City. They are served from a basket, and they keep hot the entire day as they are served. The highlight here was the chicharr√≥n taco with chicharr√≥n salsa.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria El Abanico - This is Lalo‚Äôs favorite restaurant in Mexico City for carnitas, the wildly popular braised pork taco. The entire rib in my taco was the highlight, so tender and flavorful.
Price - 20 MXN ($1.08) per taco

El Pescadito de Sonora - Originating from Hermosillo in Sonora, El Pescadito serves Mexican seafood tacos, especially shrimp or marlin tacos. Their tacototo is a taco that will change your life. This was as good as food gets for me.
Price - 35 MXN ($1.89) per taco

Tacos Charly - When it comes to Mexican street food, suadero is one of the greatest, a massive pan of slow braising beef in its juices. When you order your tacos, they slice up the meat, dip your tortilla in the fat, and you eat it with onions, cilantro, and salsa - pure meat heaven.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria Los G√ºeros - Tacos de tripa, intestines, are very popular in Mexico City as well. They may not be the most pretty tacos, but they are immensely flavorful and have all sorts of different textures going on in your mouth.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Tacos Los Juanes - This is a great Mexican street food restaurant in Mexico City that serves all sorts of different tacos. We came for the tacos de cabeza and tacos de lengua, both of which were fantastic
Price - 10 MXN ($0.54) per taco

El Vilsito - For Mexican street food in Mexico City, the ultimate taco, the most loved by everyone is no doubt, Al Pastor. Cooked in the vertical spit, a technique brought over from Lebanese immigrants, Al Pastor is usually made with marinated pork that‚Äôs juicy and flavorful it might make you weep tears of joy. Lalo and I ordered, not just your ordinary tacos de al pastor, but the King of all tacos, the Gringa!
Price - 50 MXN ($2.70) each

Thanks again to Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha: https://www.youtube.com/user/vpedoardo

This was the greatest taco day of my life. Thank you for watching!

¬ª THE TRADITIONAL FOOD IN MADAGASCAR

1. TSENA‚ÄôNY TANTSAHA TALATAMATY: Rice Porridge + Chinese Noodle Soup
ADDRESS: Talatamaty City  
OPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) 

Four miles outside of Madagascar‚Äôs capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country‚Äôs largest local morning markets, Tsena‚Äôny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. 

ü•£RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. 

ü•°CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. 
----
2. TALATA VOLON‚ÄôONDRY: Sausage + Koba
ADDRESS: Talata Volon‚Äôondry 
OPEN: Varies 

Talata Volon‚Äôondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar‚Äôs national snack, koba. 

ü•îSAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 

üá≤üá¨KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. 

Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.
üí∏PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA

EoYFFbVKX5E,Disneyland FOOD REVIEW! Best &amp; Worst Foods,"I visited the happiest place on earth Disneyland! Disneyland is known for its attractions and rides, but I didn't go there for that. I went to go on a food adventure to see what best and worst foods they served in Disneyland. After touring the food stalls at the park, I had to get some real dinner because eating the food at the park didn't fill me up as much. So I went to eat some Chinese food at one of my favorite restaurants in San Gabriel.

D59Ld3KKM6M,LONDON STREET FOOD,"LONDON STREET FOOD, Southbank Centre‚Äôs food market offers fantastic street food, a great range of beers, wines and cocktails, delicious coffee, tea and sweet treats ‚Äì with a selection of fresh produce to take home, and guest traders each week. All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London‚Äôs top food destinations.

You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.

What‚Äôs to eat?
Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian‚Äôs family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather‚Äôs hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you‚Äôre getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",food

The bacteria in our guts can break down food the body can‚Äôt digest, produce important nutrients, regulate the immune system, and protect against harmful germs.

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:

HyGPqS29Xwo,Eating BALUT for the FIRST TIME- Philippines Street Food,"Eating Balut for the first time. Balut is a 17 day old duck embryo and popular filipino street food. Trying balut was difficult, I had to pull feathers and bones out of my mouth! Later, I took a self-made Philippines Street Food Tour trying Ihaw-Ihaw which is grilled chicken intestines and the famous Lechon, a whole roasted pig. It could have competed with the best lechon in the Philippines! Although eating Lechon for the first time was absolutely delicious, eating balut was terrifying!

To make this philippines street food tour, I asked local filipinos what their favorite filipino foods were. They were all egging me on to try Balut. Get it? EGGing me on? Haha. I am a lover of exotic foods but this was definitely the strangest filipino food I have ever tasted! Always, they said we couldn‚Äôt leave Boracay without trying one of Boracay best foods, the Balut!

We loved our time in the Philippines and I enjoyed the food in the Philippines even more! Be on the lookout for more Philippines travel vlogs because we have more coming your way. Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe and become part of the DBV Fam! Leave a comment down below and tell us which of these 3 philippines street foods you would try.

Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is an experience characterised by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin. It is most commonly triggered by specific acoustic, visual and digital media stimuli, and less commonly by intentional attentional control. Also known as ""brain massage"", ""head tingle"", and ""brain tingle‚Äù.

yWhU40m-6uU,15 Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD!,"We all know Gordon Ramsay is famous for screaming insults and spitting out food, but there are times where Gordon Ramsay is actually nice and is impressed by the food! We put together a list of 15 times when Gordon Ramsay actually liked the food! Like we‚Äôve seen in our two previous videos, it does happen. It‚Äôs just pretty rare. That's why we continued to search high and low so we could show more of those happier times in Gordon‚Äôs life.  

Most chefs are incapable of satisfying Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs sophisticated needs, but every now and then a chef manages to blow Ramsay away. It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but we‚Äôve found the rare instances where Gordon Ramsay actually enjoyed the food. Just like we‚Äôve seen in our past videos, Gordon Ramsay has had a few moments where he actually liked the food that other people have prepared for him. We‚Äôve done some additional research and found 15 more Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD from other people on shows such as MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, and The F Word.

As you have seen in our other videos. Gordon Ramsay liking food is not a hoax. This actually happened. So, hold onto your forks & knives, because you are about to be blown away for the 3rd time!

About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",food

Mid-19th-Century Hanayashiki Amusement Park has thrill rides and cafes, while riverside Kuritsu Sumida Park hosts regular festivals and firework displays. Casual izakaya bars dot the neighborhood, as well as yakitori restaurants serving grilled meat skewers and beer.

ü•íABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. 

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

I'm in Tel Aviv with The Hungry Tourist food tour eating some the best pitas, street foods, and local restaurants they have in this country.

We started at a MUST try in my opinion at a true farm to table restaurant called Igra Rama Brenner St 2, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel

Then it was for a rainbow pita sandwich called Sabich and one of the BEST places for that is Sabich HaSharon Tuval St 34, Ramat Gan, Israel

After browsing the local market it was off the lunch at Azura with over 50 DISHES! 
Mikve Israel St 1, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel

The next day it was dinner at the world class seafood restaurant  Pescado Martin Buber St 1, Ashdod, Israel

and for a midnight snack it was skewers at Jasmino which is a must try! Allenby St 99, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel

_44jTTbD8Yo,Why Mumbo Sauce Is the Key to D.C.&#39;s Subculture | Food Grails,"Welcome to Food Grails, First We Feast traveling food and culture series hosted by Miss Info. As a music journalist, she's travelled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city‚Äôs flavor‚Äîfrom Atlanta's lemon-pepper wings, to NYC's beef patties. These are America‚Äôs food grails.

In episode 3, Miss Info heads to Washington D.C. to find out about the city's regional specialty, mumbo sauce. Whether you like yours dark-red or orange, tangy or peppery, mumbo is at the core of D.C.'s subculture. But as the city undergoes gentrification, will mumbo sauce retain its vitality? We spoke to Wale, Shy Glizzy, Kokayi, and Tony Lewis Jr. to find out what the future holds for the city's special sauce.

iD40RQDb34E,10 Fast Food Restaurants of The Future,"Here's a list of 10 Fast Food Restaurants of The Future! The future is hard to predict so join us as we count down the top 10 ways fast food will change in the future!
‚û°Ô∏è Subscribe to BabbleTop: https://bit.ly/2Uu3HPe

Fast food restaurants have become essential in the daily lives of many people. But recently, more and more people are avoiding them because of the greasy and high-fat foods. With mainstream fast food restaurants adding vegetarian and vegan options to their menu, like the Beyond Burger a plant based meatless patty, they are looking at a changing landscape - not only in menu but in technological innovations. While no one is going to knock Mickey D‚Äôs off the throne just yet, here are the fast food restaurants and companies that are paving the way for the menus of the future.

If you enjoyed this list of the top 10 fast food restaurants of the future, then comment: #FastFood #Restaurants #Food

TIMESTAMPS: 
0:46 Salad and Go
2:23 Cultured South
3:44 Veggie Grill
4:54 Freshii
6:23 Impossible Foods
8:01 Cafe X
9:28 By Chloe
10:57 Eatsa
12:14 The Herbivorous Butcher
13:29 Next Level Burger

SUMMARIES:
- Who says salads can‚Äôt be a part of a drive-thru menu? Well, thanks to Salad and Go‚Äôs innovativeness, you don‚Äôt have to consume a daily donut and coffee for breakfast (and fries, like some people do).
- Cultured South is not serving Beyond Burgers nor any other innovative plant-based meat. Instead, this casual restaurant is a kombucha taproom. Kombucha is what the ancient Chinese referred to as the ‚Äúimmortal health elixir.‚Äù 
- Just like The Beyond Burger‚Äôs healthy patties, Veggie Grill‚Äôs burgers are also plant based which primarily consists of pea protein. They also have ‚Äúchicken‚Äù sandwiches on their menu which consists of soy, pea, and wheat protein. 
- Freshii is way ahead of its vegan food chain rivals. This fast food restaurant has been serving salads, wraps, and bowls for nearly 15 years. Started in Canada in 2005, it now prides itself in having more than 300 franchises worldwide.
- Due to The Beyond Burger‚Äôs success, the race for the best vegan burger has started. While not a restaurant, Impossible Foods joined the battle in the search for an innovative vegan food that could be loved by avid carnivores, too.
- For Cafe X, many questioned if a robot can really make a quality cup of coffee but indeed, many customers gave rave reviews. Starting to serve people in 2017, the Cafe X robot did not fail. 
- If you are a foodie and a social media buff rolled into one, then By Chloe is a must visit. It‚Äôs not just another vegan food place serving healthy food, but the whole setup itself is optimized for social media. You might call their food instafood instagood with all the bright colors, attractive interior designs, and tempting menu.
- Eatsa is another food chain that is ahead of its time. Hungry customers can place their order on the iPad on display inside the shop. Although cashiers were replaced by tablet screens, human workers still prepare and cook these orders in the back.
- The Herbivorous Butcher is a vegan butcher shop owned by siblings Kale and Aubry Walch. Wait, a vegan butcher? Yes, you heard that right, a butcher shop but without the slaughter. It‚Äôs actually a vegan shop that started at home.
- True to its name, this burger joint brings the burgers to your table to the next level. It‚Äôs not because they boast that their burgers come from an ethical farm or because they‚Äôll serve them just like an expensive restaurant does. It is because their burger is plant-based. Its ingredients are composed of pea protein, yeast extract, and coconut oil.

u1Kc2-mIkyk,Sascha Is Addicted to Food and Ashamed of Herself | Fat Doctor | Only Human,"Sacha Whitehead is 32-years old and weighs over 30 stone. She is super morbidly obese and addicted to food. Sacha lives with her nine-year old son, Lewis, who is also overweight. Her weight is ruining her life - she is so ashamed of her size, she refuses to get out of the car when she picks up Lewis from school - fearing he will get bullied as a result. Her decision to undergo surgery was prompted by the realisation that she would only survive a maximum of five years without any surgery. She is petrified of dying on the operating table and leaving her son alone.

Fat Doctor goes on a remarkable journey following the patients of three of Britain‚Äôs most sought after weight loss surgeons. It focuses on the obese patients who undergo the operations and discovers why they became obese and the impact life changing and often life saving weight loss surgery has on their lives. We find out what their lives are like now and how this has affected their physical, social and psychological lives.

f9P5Phj0TFY,A taste of conflict: The politics of food in Jerusalem - Street Food,"The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to three different faiths: for Jews it is the site of their first holy temple; for Christians it is the scene of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection; and for Muslims it is the location of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven.A site of vast historical and religious significance, this beautiful city is also a tragic one - fought over for centuries and coveted by millions who have never set foot in it. It is at the heart of the ongoing and seemingly irresolvable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and everything there is overshadowed by politics.Jerusalem's old city enthralls with its bustling markets and vibrant street life, but inside its walls, tensions are never far from the surface. History is a dimension of the present and there is little unity to be found in a city which Palestinians regard as their occupied capital.In the struggle for the soul of a city, even food - a marker of identity, an expression of history, culture, and values - plays a part, and the roots of certain foods are fiercely debated.For Palestinians, denied a state and with a national identity which is constantly undermined, food plays an even greater role in defining who they are.Almost half of Israeli Jews come from Middle Eastern backgrounds where their parents and grandparents lived alongside Arabs in countries such as Iraq, Yemen and Morocco. Many dishes are a reminder of the shared history and culture of Arabs and Jews - something easily forgotten in today's divided politics. In a city where Israelis and Palestinians attach great meaning and symbolism to food - whether religious, political or both - we visit a unique place, Eucalyptus, which is jointly owned by Palestinians and Israelis.There, we sample dishes made by an Israeli Jew, a Palestinian Muslim, an Armenian, and a Palestinian Christian who, as 'Chefs for Peace', cook together to bridge religious and political divides. Convinced that ignorance about the other is at the heart of the conflict, the chefs try to educate people about others' history, traditions, and culture through the medium of food. This film was first broadcast on Al Jazeera English in July 2008.- Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera- Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",food

More people have food allergies than ever before. Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and even milk‚Ä¶ the list of possibly dangerous foods seems to get longer every day. But why do some people‚Äôs bodies have deadly reactions food?  And why are food allergies on the rise?

Some fellow YouTubers tell us their stories of what it‚Äôs like to live with food allergies, and we bring you the best current science on how to prevent food allergies in kids and adults.

PVEeScXdSVU,Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. 
As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

5oQbCOz9nlU,üá®üá≥ Food for thought: China&#39;s Food Safety | 101 East,"Every year two million people die from unsafe food and water around the world. Food safety experts warn these deaths may be caused by human design, and nowhere is this trend more prevalent than in China.

Tracing the making of a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a 101 East investigation exposes the toxic stew this iconic dish has become.

From tainted additives in noodles, to growth hormones in pork, to industrial filler posing as meat, presenter Steve Chao finds that anything is possible for producers looking to cut corners and make a fast buck.

Do you have a story about Chinese food you consumed?  @AJ101East goes undercover to expose the hidden harm in China's Food Industry.

03vWwqYPf60,Organic food - hype or hope? | DW Documentary,"There is growing demand in the western world for organic food. But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?

Is organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk ""organic"" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare.

NGxcr_Z8Dmw,5 Must-Try Japanese Food Experiences in Tokyo,"Japanese Food is awesome, and the overall dining experience is just as fun. If you are looking for places to eat in Tokyo, here are five great Japanese food experiences that I love while living in Tokyo. 

1. Japanese Grill (Robata) - You sit around a few men who cook all of the meat and vegetables right in front of you on a grill. You just point to what you want and they grab it with their giant wooden spatulas. 

2. Ramen - My favorite Japanese food, and perhaps the most well recognized Japanese dish apart from sushi. There are hundreds of places to choose from in Tokyo, each with their own rendition of the classic. One spot where you can get a large variety of options is on ""Ramen Street"" in the lower level of Tokyo Station. 

3. Yakitori - Meat and veggies on sticks, cooked over a similar grill as the Robata, Yakitori is a favorite among Tokyo residents because it's fast and goes great with beer. The most famous area for Yakitori in Tokyo is down ""Memory Lane"" or ""Piss Alley"" just outside the Shinjuku Train Station. 

4. Chanko Nabe - The ultimate in gluttony for a normal civilian, but a necessary bulking strategy for up-and-coming sumo wresters in the Ryogoku neighborhood of Tokyo. There are many different versions of this massive stew, and they are all aggressive and delicious. 

5. Conveyor Belt Sushi - As I mention in the video, there are a million different ways sushi is served in Tokyo. One of the most fun methods is by way of the conveyor belt sushi. 

*Bonus* - Convenient stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson's, and 7 Eleven are a major part of Japanese Food culture in Tokyo. People are busy and need a quick meal, so I wanted to take you around real quick and show you what's inside!

In this video, I show you where to find the very best Amsterdam food! I take you on a walking tour of the Albert Cuyp Market in Amsterdam where I taste test many different Dutch street food items. 

Named after a 17th century painter, Albert Cuyp, the market has since become an institution for this bustling European city. Located on the Albert Cuypstraat (that is the name of the street) between Ferdinand Bolstraat and Van Woustraat...the market's central location makes it the perfect place to stroll through on the way to a nearby museum or on the way to a picnic. 

Visiting the Albert Cuyp Market is a definite must-see when you're in Amsterdam! Another plus is that this market is great for travelers on a budget because there are a lot of Amsterdam food options (traditional Dutch dishes) that can be had for under $3 Euro. 

A list of Amsterdam street food I ate at the Albert Cuyp Market:

I began with my favorite item, the stroopwafel. When I think of Amsterdam food, stroopwafel is the first thing that comes to mind. Essentially it is a waffle, but it's nothing like an American waffle. This unique pastry is made with flour, butter and sugar, but the real excitement is in the middle of the waffle. The waffle is cut in the middle (which is a miracle because it is so thin!) and then copious amounts of brown sugar syrup are knifed onto it, and then it is sealed once again. Stroopwafel is best eaten warm! The predominant flavor is cinnamon and the waffle itself is both crisp on the outside but soft inside. It's absolutely delightful and it tasted a lot different than I was expecting. 

Next, I tried some raw herring called Nieuwe Herring which translates into ‚ÄúNew Herring.‚ÄùThis means that the fish has either been caught that actual day or the day prior. Nieuwe Herring is another must try dish when it comes taste testing Amsterdam food! Since it was herring season in the summertime (until around Sept), I decided to try out some fresh herring the Dutch way (with pickles and raw onions). It was absolutely incredible! I am now a herring addict.

After this I drank some fresh pressed raspberry juice mixed with blackberries and orange juice. You can find juice stands all along the market. A normal glass of juice costs around 1 EUR. 

Then after this, I moved onto a spicy chicken sandwich at Benny's Chicken. This food stand claims to have the best chicken in all of Amsterdam. After tasting their spicy chicken sandwich covered in cheese, I have to admit that is was really good! The pieces of chicken are succulent and juicy. Definitely a delicious sandwich if you're craving something cheesy!

After this I bought some dates at Ron's Notenbar. Notenbars (which literally translates into ‚Äúnut bar‚Äù) are a very common sight in Amsterdam. There are a couple notenbars at the Albert Cuyp Market and they all offer different items which is nice. Duchies love their fresh fruits and nuts, especially as a mid-day snack! I was impressed by their selection of dates, but I highly recommend getting a couple bags of different dried fruits and nuts.  

Next, I purchased some aged gouda cheese at a cheese shop called Daalder Kaas. They sell traditionally ripened cheese and an array of aged gouda cheeses. I selected an aged gouda cheese which I thought was nice and creamy. It had a sharp flavor, but wasn't overwhelming. 

I thought all of the Amsterdam food I tasted at the market was wonderful!  Make sure to come earlier than 5pm as some vendors tend to pack up around 3pm (or when they sell out of the goods). It's best to arrive in the early afternoon.

Flint (Bill Hader) and the gang discover an island of living food animals.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Picking up precisely where its hit predecessor left off, Sony Pictures Animation's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 finds Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) invited to join the Live Corp Company, and use his gift for invention for the good of mankind. Just as young Flint prepares to go to work for his hero Chester V (voice of Will Forte), however, the young genius learns that his water-to-food machine is not only still functional, but it's also started cross-breeding animals with food. Now, in order to prevent a growing army of ""foodimals"" from escaping isolation on an island and wreaking havoc on the mainland, Flint and his loyal group of friends will have to do battle with such delicious, but deadly, hybrids as the ferocious tacodiles, slithering apple pie-thons, and vine-swinging shrimpanzees. Saving the world from these rampaging monstrosities won't be easy, but if anyone is up to the task, it's Flint and company. Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn takes the reins for this sequel also featuring vocal contributions by Anna Faris, James Caan, Kristen Schaal, Terry Crews, Andy Samberg, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt.

This is the fourth episode of Climate Lab, a six-part series produced by the University of California in partnership with Vox. Hosted by Emmy-nominated conservation scientist Dr. M. Sanjayan, the videos explore the surprising elements of our lives that contribute to climate change and the groundbreaking work being done to fight back.

Sanjayan is an alum of UC Santa Cruz and a Visiting Researcher at UCLA. Check back next Wednesday for the next episode. Visit http://climate.universityofcalifornia.edu for more.

awtmTJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. 


As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.

TEDxTeen opening music by BlackDoe

Rob is an adventurer, activist, and dude making a difference. His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he‚Äôs dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.

5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters‚Äìled by Alice Waters‚Äìvoiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

mLRjb6LdUFM,Tossed Out: Food Waste in America,"Food waste is the single-largest source of waste in municipal landfills. According to the EPA, 35 billion pounds of food were thrown away in 2011. As it decomposes in landfills, the waste releases methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, 1 in 7 Americans struggles with hunger and the world wonders how to address the challenge of feeding 9 billion people by 2050.

go_QOzc79Uc,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.

Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.

Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.

1r0ocJbsY-g,Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food,"Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food

Exploring the cultural diversity exemplified throughout the vibrant street food scene in New York City.
Known as the Big Apple, New York City is home to about nine million people [‚âà population of Honduras, nation] and hosts an additional 40 million visitors every year, which makes for a lot of stomachs to feed. 

Quick snacks, above all the hot dog, are as synonymous with New York as yellow cabs and skyscrapers and reflect the city's eclectic ethnic mix.

Yet few people realise that many of the city's thousands of street vendors - including Brooklyn's famed 'Falafel King' - face a daily struggle that belies the city's wealthy and glamourous image.

As the first signs of Manhattan's morning hustle and bustle surface, the city's street vendors have already been at work for many hours. Storage garages are busy with the sound of these business owners cleaning and gleaming, stocking and getting things in order for their long days ahead.

Although there are many vendors native to NYC, there is a significant number of immigrant owners - many of whom have run their businesses for decades.

Their food carts symbolise a lot more than a quick and convenient snack for the hundreds of thousands that pound the pavements of the city. They are a chance to live life on their own terms, often after escaping political turmoil or significant economic instability in their homelands. 

But the challenge is far from ideal. Obstacles to a successful business range from finding the perfect selling spot - in spite of an unspoken brotherhood between the vendors that can and has led to rivalries - and adhering to legislation surrounding health and safety, to liquidity and endless working hours. 

On the other side of the river, street vendors in Brooklyn and Queens face an even tougher uphill battle. Catering to a rougher demographic, and often without the means - both financial and otherwise - food cart owners, many of whom are new to the US, tend to find themselves operating illegally and, at times, even dangerously. 

Follow this episode of Street Food to get a glimpse into the good, the bad and the delicious of New York's vendors.

SUMMARY
-A glass of juice contains 5‚Äì6 teaspoons of sugar. The dissolved sugar immediately gets absorbed into the bloodstream, which is bad for the metabolism of carbohydrates.
-Yogurts with fruit contain a lot of sugar, fat, and calories, which all lead to children becoming overweight. It also increases their risk of getting diabetes.
-Flakes, muesli, and other similar cereals contain is a lot of sugar. All the healthy elements of corn, wheat, and oats are removed during production ‚Äî only the carbohydrates are left.
-Honey can cause an allergic reaction, and sometimes honey contains bacteria, which can lead to a serious infectious disease called botulism.
-Grapes are large and slippery, and a child could choke on them. Grapes are also very difficult for a child‚Äôs digestive tract to process.
-No matter how harmless animal-shaped vitamins look, they should only be prescribed by doctors.
-Drinking fatty milkshakes regularly can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases.
-French fries, burgers, and pizza are loaded with salt, sugar, and saturated fat. When consumed regularly, this deadly trio could cause obesity, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular diseases.
-Caffeine, which is an ingredient in coffee, could affect calcium absorption, and this might weaken their bones.
-Soda contains calories, artificial sweeteners, and caffeine, all of which erode tooth enamel and cause mood swings.
-Processed meats like hot dogs, bacon, and bologna are rich in sodium and saturated fat. However, when consumed daily and in large amounts, they may increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and spikes in blood pressure.
-Chicken nuggets must go because they‚Äôre packed with preservatives, calories, salt, and a bit of sugar. 
-Potato chips contain loads of sodium and fat. Chips should never land in your grocery basket, and they should stay out of your child‚Äôs life as well.
-Ketchup is made from sugar, corn syrup, food coloring, and extra fat.
-Mac and cheese contains sodium, food preservatives, and noodles stripped of fiber. This same goes for canned spaghetti and ramen in plastic packages. 
-Canned tuna contains high levels of mercury, which is dangerous for their health.
-Cake, cookies, doughnuts, candies, and fruit snacks can cause tooth decay and cavities.
-According to the FDA, unpasteurized milk carries dangerous bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli, and listeria.

Maruti Suzuki leads from the front with a massive market share of over 49 percent followed by Hyundai Motor India. Here is a complete analysis of auto sales in India and what to expect going forward in 2018. With all eyes on Auto Expo 2018, expect car sales in India to further grow this year. Please follow the list below :


* 10. Volkswagen: This German manufacturer just edges past Chevrolet to make it into this Top 10 list for 2018. A large part of its success is driven by the Polo hatchback and Vento sedan models. As part of the Volkswagen AG group, brands like Audi and Skoda also contribute to the sales numbers.

* 9. Nissan: The Indian arm of Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan Motor Company's wholesale deliveries reported an increase of 39 percent in April 2017 to 4,217 vehicles. The company, in a statement, has credited this growth in sales to customer demand for the Datsun Redi-GO.
 
* 8. Ford India: As a brand, Ford has its share of loyalists in India. Their Ikon 1.6 and subsequently Fiesta S have been driver-centric cars. At the other end of the market, they also have the Endeavour ‚Äì one of India‚Äôs‚Äô first true SUVs, with a ladder-on-frame construction, butch styling, and impressive road presence.

* 7. Renault: This French manufacturer has a range that covers most segments in the Indian market. They have the entry-level Pulse hatchback, which is a rebadged Nissan Micra, as part of its alliance with Nissan Motors in India. The Scala sedan is a popular sedan and shares its market space with the Nissan Sunny.

* 6. Toyota: The name has become synonymous with quality. This has been a constant refrain with the owners and drivers of its most popular product in India, the Innova. Despite the premium pricing and long waiting periods, the Innova continues to be the market leader in its segment every month.

* 5. Honda Cars: As a brand name, Honda has always held a special place in the hearts of Indians. The interiors are of good quality, and the ride and handling are comfortable. Honda‚Äôs after sales service is one of the best and is responsible for most of its repeat customers.

* 4. Tata Motors: A massive automotive company with an incredible range of vehicles, Tata nevertheless has struggled sometimes when it comes to passenger cars. They had a very successful run with the Indica and Indigo series of hatchbacks and sedans.

* 3. Mahindra & Mahindra: India popular home-grown automaker, Mahindra has been a leader in transportation in rural areas. They have focused on a strong, rugged image and built a reputation for reliability. Coupled with value for money features, Mahindra vehicles have become known for being easy to own and cheap to maintain.

* 2. Hyundai India: As a brand, Hyundai was unknown when it launched in India. From there to becoming India‚Äôs second Best build car brand is a success story that needs to be told. The very first model they launched, the Santro was an unmitigated success.

* 1. Maruti Suzuki: Our very own Maruti Suzuki holds an impressive 42% of the market at the end of last month. They sold over 92000 vehicles in thirty days. And this was not a great month ‚Äì in fact, it was the lowest in over a year. The average monthly sales are actually over 110000.

eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled.

-bDtCwNo-oo,Traditional Enamel Dial Manufacturing,"Dials made of enamel can last forever, have a great smooth aspect, are prestigious because of their very artisenal production process and have existed since the 17th century. We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. 

Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don‚Äôt produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.

This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950¬∞C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.

A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",manufacturing
a7YvJB0n16I,Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing  (Free Simulation),"Lean Simulation:  Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing

This video shows a preview of a Push versus Pull computer simulation model by The Big Lean Simulation Library:  

http://TheBigLeanSimulationLibrary.wordpress.com

From here, you can obtain the full version of the video tutorial, the simulation model itself, and how-to instructions for demonstrating the model.  You can show this as part of your Lean Six Sigma course offerings (LSS White Belt, Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt.).  Lean and Lean Six Sigma consultants can also use it as a tool to sell your Lean consulting work to management and executives.  Advanced practitioners will already know the concepts but will appreciate the ability to show them to others in an easy to understand format.

This simulation consists of three scenarios.

Scenario 1:  This shows a push manufacturing system.  The first workstation produces a run of 100 parts.  The second workstation processes those parts at a slower rate.  As a result, the ""pushed"" parts add excess inventory and Work-In-Process (WIP).  In addition, the first workstation experiences a quality problem after 30 documents.  As a result, about 70 defective parts are produced before the downstream workstation catches the problem and tells the first workstation.

Scenario 2:  In this scenario, we use a Pull based kanban system to process parts only when the second workstation is able to process them.  As a result, key metrics for Work-In-Process and quality are dramatically improved while still producing at the same rate.

Scenario 3:  Travel time is reduced, thus allowing fewer kanbans.  All metrics are improved further.

The final view shows optional discussion bullet points.

MANUFACURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT:Raw Materials: The raw materials required for cement manufacture are. Lime stone which provides calcium. Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",manufacturing

bhHiMzDP3pU,The New Manufacturing: Ted Hall at TEDxRichmond,"Ted Hall, founder and CEO of ShopBot Tools, Inc., first got excited about digital fabrication 20 years ago. Ted wanted a digitally controlled tool that would cut plywood parts for backyard boatbuilding projects. In trying to find such a tool, he learned that the CNC (computer numerically controlled) technology of the time was heavily industrial and oriented to high-volume manufacturing. Ted's idea, which would become ShopBot, was to create a digital fabrication tool that was instead oriented to use by individuals and small shops. A tool that took advantage of the technology's capability to cut, drill, sculpt, machine, carve, or trim with high precision and in relation to a digital model -- but that made sense in a small shop for making one object or many, and that empowered individuals through the new technology with enhanced capabilities to express their creativity in projects of all sizes and using a wide range of materials.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",manufacturing

8bT6txm4RpA,Master Hands - Chevrolet Manufacturing (1936),"Classic ""capitalist realist"" drama showing the manufacture of Chevrolets from foundry to finished vehicles. Though ostensibly a tribute to the ""master hands"" of the assembly line workers, it seems more of a paean to the designers of this impressive mass production system. Filmed in Flint, Michigan, just months before the United Auto Workers won union recognition with their famous sitdown strikes.

subeIZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,"In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download 

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

Description: The Portuguese cowbell is a traditional idiophone percussion instrument that provides an unmistakable soundscape in rural areas. Alc√°√ßovas is the main manufacturing centre where the cowbells, traditionally used by shepherds to manage livestock, are made. The practice is transmitted from father to son and requires a series of processes before the handmade iron pieces are polished and fine-tuned. Yet the tradition is becoming unsustainable as new grazing methods, cheaper industrial techniques and fewer cowbell makers are leading to its demise.

He gives us a reality check about what global trade really looks like and how shared production and open borders help us make higher quality products at lower costs.

2JfVzMvLEn8,Manufacturing in space could save life on Earth | James Orsulak | TEDxMileHigh,"You care about the future of our planet. You traded in your gas-guzzling SUV for a Prius and your Keurig for a Coffee Maker -- and if enough of us do that, we‚Äôll save the Earth, right? Well, we are dangerously close to collapsing our own ecosystem and we are running out of time. In this persuasive talk, James Orsulak argues that the only way to really make a difference is to look up. James Orsulak serves as the Director of Business Development at Planetary Resources, an asteroid mining company that has embarked on the world‚Äôs first commercial deep space exploration. The company focuses on technologies such as rocket propellant, water for life support functions, and construction materials sourced from asteroids. Previously, James spent a decade developing industrial-scale fueling stations on Earth. He is an avid gardener who lives in Denver with his amazing wife, 2-year-old twins and a rambunctious Goldendoodle named Waffles. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",manufacturing

WTZFMEDyvYk,How to Find a Supplier on Alibaba &amp; Find a Chinese Manufacturer,"This video tutorial will teach you how to find a supplier on Alibaba & find a Chinese manufacturer. 

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ Free Ebook - Make $10,000/Month Online: http://wholesaleted.com/4-step

Here are our step-by-step instructions on how to find a supplier on Alibaba:

Step 1: Go to Alibaba and find the search bar. Type in the name of a product that you are interested in selling. In this video I used vitamin pills as an example. 

Step 2: Because a lot of suppliers have duplicate listings on Alibaba for the same item (because it increases their presence in the Alibaba search engine) you will need to filter the results by clicking on ‚Äúbrowse by suppliers.‚Äù 

Step 3: To filter the results down further, search by ‚ÄúGold Suppliers.‚Äù Most suppliers will do this because it has become basically a prerequisite for having new buyers contact them. It doesn‚Äôt cost them much money to do this, so the results will only be filtered by a small amount. 

Step 4 (OPTIONAL): If the list of suppliers is still too long, then click to filter the results by ‚Äúassessed supplier.‚Äù This is only necessary in very popular niches where you have a large number of suppliers that you need to filter down to a manageable amount. 

Step 5: Contact 10-20 suppliers at least. If you have time, then contact more. The more you contact, the better.

Here is the email template referenced in our video tutorial on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: 

""My name is [INSERT NAME] from [INSERT BUSINESS NAME]. Our company director asked me to contact your company about working together on a lucrative, long-term venture. We are a company that sells products related to [INSERT NICHE HERE] and we do over 2 million dollars in sales each year. We‚Äôre looking to expand our product range and create a profitable partnership between your company and ours.

We are planning to purchase [INSERT ITEM] to our product line. It would need to meet these specifications: 

* Specification (e.g size)
* Specification (e.g. quantity)
* Specification (e.g. colour)

We have been researching different companies in China that manufacture [INSERT ITEM] and we think that your company could be a great supplier for it. We would like to get some more information and have a few questions that we would like you to please answer: 

* Can we please get a sample of the product as soon as possible. Can you please let us know how much you will charge for the sample, including Express shipping to [INSERT COUNTRY], zip code [INSERT ZIP CODE]? We would like to pay with PayPal. 
* How long will it take to receive the sample?
* What types of packaging do you usually use for this product?
* How long does it take to manufacture once an order has been placed?
* What is the product-per-unit cost including shipping via Air Express to the United States, ZIP code 85043?
* Do you accept PayPal for the full-order?""

We would be very grateful if you would contact us with answers to the above questions as well as any additional policies that we may need to know. We would also like to discuss with you further about doing a sample order for the product.

We are hopeful that we can start a mutually beneficial relationship. 

Please add me on Skype and talk to me, as this is my ideal form of communication: [INSERT ID]
Alternatively you can email me back at this address: [INSERT ADDRESS]

Kind regards,
[NAME]‚Äù

Here are some final tips to keep in mind when you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba to manufacture your Amazon FBA private label products: 

Tip #1 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Don‚Äôt judge the supplier/manufacture by their Alibaba response rate.

The Alibaba response rate only takes into account how fast they respond within Alibaba‚Äôs email system, and it doesn‚Äôt take into account how fast they reply to personal emails. This is not a good indicator of how responsive they will be to private communication, which is all you should care about.

Tip #2 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Avoid manufacturers that try to vet your business. 

If a manufacturer comes back and starts asking questions about your business, clearly skeptical of the size of your company, it is best to move on. Manufacturers that do this will usually decline to work with you as they are only to work with other large companies, so you don‚Äôt want to waste your time. 

Tip #3 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: It is OK to work directly with a sales rep - if they offer you a better deal. 

When you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba, you‚Äôll discover that sales reps often have inflated prices (due to commission cuts). But occasionally, a sales rep will have a better relationship with a factory and so are able to negotiate lower prices. They will also often have good english, making communication easier. Vet sales reps and treat them as equals during the process of picking and choosing the right supplier.",manufacturing

When completed, it will be the world‚Äôs largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. 

We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn‚Äôt require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. 

The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it‚Äôs one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.

This movie shows you the process of manufacturing solar cells with heterojunction technology:

Texturing
For high efficiency HJT cells, damages from cutting have to be completely removed and a special texture created by wet chemical processes. The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.

PECVD Coating
The surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination, thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.

PVD Coating
A sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.

Printing
Screen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.

Curing
Curing printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.


Testing & Sorting
Meyer Burger offers leading measurement procedures for the precise testing of high capacitance HJT cells which require a measurement speed of 400‚Äì600 ms.",manufacturing

rsSvx6JlbNI,Grand opening of Herbalife Innovation &amp; Manufacturing Facility in Winston-Salem,"Herbalife officially unveiled the grand opening of its Innovation & Manufacturing Facility in Winston-Salem today. Members of the local business, civic community, along with Herbalife executives, were on hand to take local officials and the media on a tour of the facility. Herbalife promised more than 500 jobs to the local community. So far, more than 350 jobs have been filled, with more to come by the end of the year.  Herbalife Innovation & Manufacturing (H.I.M.) in Winston- Salem further expands Herbalife global manufacturing capacity and is in line with the company's strategy toincrease self-manufacturing for its top products.  H.I.M. Winston-Salem is an example of significant investment by Herbalife in cutting-edge technology and innovation. The site includes a Quality Control center where physical, chemical and microbiological testing occurs, and a Research and Development lab staffed with technicians and scientists. The facility produces a variety of nutritional products, including powders, such as the flagship Formula 1 Nutritional Shake Mix; liquids, such as the Herbal Aloe Concentrate; and teas, such as Herbal Tea Concentrate. Products manufactured at HIM Winston-Salem will be distributed in the United States and exported to more than 50 countries around the world.  Since announcing the Triad location in December 2012, Herbalife has invested more than $100 million to convert the over 800,000 square foot site to meet its exacting specifications. 
 
The retro-fit of the building ensures it is in full compliance with U.S. Good Manufacturing Practices for dietary supplements, acidified foods and food products. Within months of its operational start-up, the facility received NSF accreditation‚Äîa certification key to ensuring that products manufactured in Winston Salem meet strict standards for public health protection -- and its quality control laboratory received the highly regarded ISO 17025 certification. The flagship facility for Herbalife, and one of the most advanced facilities in the nutrition industry as a whole, also houses Herbalife‚Äôs technical operations Center of Excellence, an R&D laboratory complex that ensures products are backed by the best nutrition science.
 
HIM Winston-Salem is Herbalife‚Äôs second U.S. manufacturing facility and the largest of four company-owned facilities worldwide (one in Lake Forest, California and two in China).  Herbalife will also locate its Global Technical Operations Center, as well as state-of-the-art quality and testing laboratories at the Winston-Salem location.
 
Facts: Currently approximately 350 employees; will employ more than 500 when facility reaches full production by the end of 2015. The 800,000 square-foot facility is one-mile around. Equivalent to 200 basketball courts or 16 football fields ‚Äì enough room for an entire Sunday of NFL games to be played simultaneously. Estimated to produce 150 million units per year‚Äîthat‚Äôs 600,000 per day. Green features include energy efficient diode lights and integral water purification system, which processes water to make it pH-neutral ahead of disposal. The company has also extended its innovative wellness program to its employees in Winston Salem, including the annual bio-metric health screening and wellness coaching along with a comprehensive fitness center that includes basketball courts and a nature trail. The company is active in the local community and supports a number of organizations, including the North Carolina Soccer Fusion youth soccer organization and local cycling club Team MS Herbalife.

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

XE3XJK8CG6I,5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries,"5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries

Rich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal‚Äôs skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth‚Äôs body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs next!",history

[This Is The Greatest Bank Heist in Chinese History]

Handan, China; October 10th, 2006. It was getting dark.

The vault manager of the Agricultural Bank of China was on edge. He was afraid. He felt something wasn‚Äôt quite right. Yes there were two security guards patrolling the grounds, which made him feel safer, but as vault manager he needed to be sure himself. 

He checked the printer room, the conference room, there was no one there, no sign of trouble. 

Then he entered the vault‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶where everything was also fine; the money was there, the bank‚Äôs security system was down. In fact, everything was just as he planned. 

He started counting the money, but he knew he had to be quick, the paranoia was starting to get to him. He shoved the cash in his duffel bag, and swiftly left the vault. 

For Ren Xiaofeng, it was good to be the man in charge, it made robbing the Agricultural Bank of China that much easier. 

But he still had to be careful, he wasn‚Äôt out of the woods yet....",history

--

In the German town of N√∂rdlingen in 1593, innkeeper Maria H√∂ll found herself accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning, and denied the charges. She insisted she wasn‚Äôt a witch through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers finally released her. Other accused witches weren‚Äôt so ‚Äúlucky."" Why did these witch hunts occur? Brian A. Pavlac digs into this horrific chapter in human history.

History of the Cold War (in One Take) by History Bombs

The Cold War was a vast, global conflict that lasted from 1945 - 1991 and had a significant impact on many regions of the world. 

Towards the end of World War Two, the communist Soviet Union and capitalist United States of America began to vie for dominance as they asserted themselves as global superpowers, capable of extending their influence worldwide.

From the Potsdam Conference to the fall of the Berlin Wall, this video charts the course of the Cold War, including Kennan's Long Telegram, the Berlin Airlift, the Sino-Soviet Alliance, the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War and the Soviet-Afghan War.

Human history is truly a swinging pendulum of ups and downs. The centuries have been sprinkled with both terrible, bleak events, and beautiful hopeful moments.

Since the invention of the photograph, those events and moments have been recorded for us, allowing us a window into a time that we never actually got to see for ourselves.

This is India! Just look how beautiful, magical and spiritual this place is. Green trees, deep blue rivers, hot shining sun‚Ä¶ India. Are you ready to travel back in time again? Buckle up because it‚Äôs going to be a long rough ride! 

Once upon a time, or to be more accurate, around 70,000 years ago people in Africa decided that they got tired of living with angry hungry neighbors aka hungry animals. They left the continent and reached India. It was a long hard way. The scientists will later call it the coastal migration. Yep, they have a word for everything. 

They didn‚Äôt stand idly by. They beginning to learn the surroundings and by 6,500 BC began farming. They also raised cattle, goats, and sheep. Water buffalo were used to pull carts. Guys, now that we have food, let‚Äôs created something to store it in. By 5,500 BC they intended and widely used pottery. Well done people.

I'll try to make this mapping series as much realistic as I can, but there will be some things which will be made up and maybe sometimes unlikely to happen, to make a story line and the series much better (I hope). There may be some mistakes in the editing/grammar mistakes/typos, so please be reasonable. Don't take this video seriously, because it's made just for fun.

What is mapping actually?

Mapping is the creation of maps, a graphic symbolic representation of the significant features of a part of the surface of the Earth. With a random scenarios, stories, the creator is able to make a future or the history (depends of the series) using his/her imagination.

zKLH-N_X5j4,The Worst Punishments For Women In History That You Can&#39;t Believe,"‚ùÄ ‚ô° ‚ô™    Instead of punishing with death, ancient and modern nations have created many forms of cruel torture exclusively for women ...
10 most terrifying tortures in history
Boiling public opinion: 6-year-old baby tortured by her mother and mistress like an enemy
Horror: Tortured and burned because of suspected witch
""Rustic"" - Sitting wooden horse

When convicted of adultery, the woman was stripped of all her clothes and tied to a torture device with a saddle / donkey shape, in the middle there was a rough round wooden stick similar to the penis attached to the wheel shaft to move, some even get nailed around.


The wooden penis will be plugged into the vagina, when the horse runs, it will bump up on the vulva, causing the offender to bleed and suffer, and the victim will scream miserably.

Most people who are tortured in this form cannot escape death, and if they do, they will be disabled for life.

Hand clamps

This penalty was applied in Chinese feudal dynasties, which lasted until the end of Qing dynasty (19th century). This is also the most popular torture instrument for women during this period.

The woman suspected of adultery will have to put her fingers into a specialized tool for torture. This device will squeeze the victim's fingertip.

If it is too painful, the victim will faint, the cold water will be flushed to the province to continue suffering.

In addition, this form also appeared in Middle Eastern European countries with a device called ""hand grip"".

They are designed in all sizes to crush every part of the female body, from the hands, feet to the knees, even the head of the offender.

D7c7rxNUgnY,The Criminal History of Chief Keef,"Chief Keef is one of the most iconic rappers in Hip Hop history. At only 15 years old, the south side Chicago rapper took the rap game by storm after being one of the first people to really put Chicago drill music on the map. Chief Keef‚Äôs demonic style of hip hop was like nothing we‚Äôve ever seen before and had everyone from the streets all the way to the suburbs anxiously waiting for the next Chief Keef record to be released. But it wasn‚Äôt just the sound of the music that created all this hype around Chief Keef and the Chicago drill scene, it was rather the actual lyrics he was saying in his music. It was all authentic. Nobody even questioned it for a second. All it took was 30 seconds of a Chief Keef song and music video to figure out that Sosa was about that life. Whether he did the dirt himself or was around people who did, everyone knew that there wasn‚Äôt any lies being told in his music‚Ä¶ and Keef  and his affiliates have the rap sheet to prove it. Here is an exclusive inside look at the Criminal History of Chief Keef.

Kate visits their HQ in Sydney to investigate the sophisticated rapid response system designed to kick into action the second a fire is reported, while Simon joins a crew racing to stamp out a grass fire threatening a nearby town and joins a team trekking through remote bushland to extinguish spot fires started by lightning.

In this first programme of two, Simon and Kate explore why wildfires in Australia are so frequent and hard to control, unlocking the surprising secrets of fire behaviour with leading scientists working to help those on the frontline.

Una d√©cada de idealismo, guerra y asesinatos que termin√≥ con el feudalismo e inici√≥ la igualdad y un nuevo orden mundial. La Revoluci√≥n Francesa es un documental que encapsula este importante per√≠odo de la civilizaci√≥n occidental.

vDwmyhMxuss,This is the most competitive map in Rocket League history,"Just imagine, if Psyonix added this as a gamemode for everybody to compete in time trials, even cross-platform - this game has so much potential!


Today, I go through my favorite Rocket League workshop map and attempt a Top 10 fastest speed run to secure a spot in the leader-boards. Make sure to try it for yourself! This is only possible on PC, in order to get the map, you subscribe to the steam workshop map ""Speed Jump: Trials 3""  and in the game choose ""Extras"" and ""Workshop"". Good luck!

Should I make a video of myself doing the next course from start to finish? I have not seen any of the levels for any map as I've never been on PC before recently and neither did I watch JHZER, Squishy or Scrubkilla do them as I wanted to preserve my first reaction for a video. So everything you'll see will be blind and with that, my first reactions. I could also try and give tips on how to best perform each stage, which would be an idea as well. Let me know in the comment section down below! Thank you for your time!
 
Next video will again focus dribbles, fakes and more as well as the beloved fails and funny moments. As last time we tried to shift our focus on ball resets, no flips, triple plays and more in favor of freestyling.

pxuaYPff-14,Mind-altering drugs: The magical history of LSD and mushrooms | Michael Pollan,"Why did government officials stop psychedelics from reaching mainstream culture?

- In the '60s drugs escape the lab and become a very important ingredient In the creation of the counterculture. Timothy Leary, a psychologist at Harvard in 1960, has something to do with this.

- In Cambridge, he starts the Harvard Psilocybin Project which focuses its research into learning more about this promising drug. Because of its medicinal properties, and apparent positive effect on mental health, Leary believed that everyone should use acid, or psilocybin.

- Richard Nixon called Leary the most dangerous man in America. He felt that LSD and other drugs were sapping the will of American boys to fight in Vietnam.

For the past twenty-five years, Michael Pollan has been writing books and articles about the places where nature and culture intersect: on our plates, in our farms and gardens, and in the built environment. His latest is How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence - https://amzn.to/2R1PJn4

He is the author four New York Times bestsellers: Food Rules: An Eater‚Äôs Manual (2010); In Defense of Food: An Eater‚Äôs Manifesto (2008); The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals (2006) and The Botany of Desire: A Plant‚Äôs-Eye View of the World (2001). The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma was named one of the ten best books of 2006 by both the New York Times and the Washington Post. It also won the California Book Award, the Northern California Book Award, the James Beard Award, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. A young readers edition called The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma: the Secrets Behind What You Eat was published in 2009. The Botany of Desire received the Borders Original Voices Award for the best non-fiction work of 2001, and was recognized as a best book of the year by the American Booksellers Association and Amazon.com. PBS premiered a two-hour special documentary based on The Botany of Desire in fall 2009.

And that's why we are taking a look further back than usual to introduce to the Cossacks.

Drop a LIKE for more Call of Duty stuff! (‰πÉ^o^)‰πÉ
Nifty Things Down Here: ‚ñº

Today, we use a shotgun in every single Call of Duty game ever made!

‚Ä¶except for the first COD game, Big Red One, Call of Duty Online, and Call of Duty Mobile‚Ä¶

lol

I decided to do a challenge video AGAIN; play every Call of Duty game ever made in one video, and try to get as many kills in Team Deathmatch in 1 minute, but this time with Shotguns!

This video includes gameplay and some of my opinions about Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Call of Duty 4, Call of Duty: World at War, Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 1, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 2, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Black Ops 3, Modern Warfare Remastered, Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty WW2, and Black Ops 4! That‚Äôs 15 Call of Duty games in ONE video‚Ä¶WOW

All of this footage was captured on the Xbox One at 1080p 60fps and on the PS4 at 1080p 60fps so you can see all of the graphic and gameplay changes over time!

The shotguns of Call of Duty have changed a lot over time; from the classic M1897 Trench Gun to the Brecci, COD shotguns went from 0 to 100 real quick!

As usual, I‚Äôm really surprised with the results of this challenge video as well‚Ä¶

So, what do YOU think is the best shotgun in Call of Duty of ALL TIME? Which COD game do you think has the most fun to use shotguns? Leave a comment letting me know! :D

dnV_MTFEGIY,The Atlantic Slave Trade: Crash Course World History #24,"In which John Green teaches you about one of the least funny subjects in history: slavery. John investigates when and where slavery originated, how it changed over the centuries, and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. 

Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization, but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height, or depth, of dehumanizing, brutal, chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world, it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life? In a desperate attempt at comic relief, Boba Fett makes an appearance.

DLk67oMq8Og,Old Fashioned Cocktail History &amp; Evolution | How to Drink,"A longer look at the Old-Fashioned and how to make it 5 different ways, covering its evolution from 1850-2019.  That's right: FIVE DRINKS.

**********************************

Very first Episode of HTD: https://youtu.be/mf1ax7y0yyI
You can Pre-Order Mid-Century Cocktail here:
https://amzn.to/2Xd7lzb

This week on How to Drink I'm doing a deep dive into the Old Fashioned tracing it's evolution from the room-temperature ""Cocktail"" of the 1850's all the way up to today's spirit forward speakeasy friendly drink in 2019.  I make five drinks along the way, and truth be told there's probably a lot more I could have done with this drink (the cocktail ""schism"" that coined the name ""Old-Fashioned"" was tied to reconstruction era politics and that's a whole lot to unpack) but this episode was already twenty minutes long so I figured we save that for another day.

The 1850's Cocktail
1 sugar cube Soak with bitters
~ 2oz. -or- 60 ml. of spirit (I go with Genever here)
~ 3oz. -or- 90 ml. of Water (could be less)
Stir till sugar dissolves
Garnish with grated nutmeg (or the twist of your choice)

1860's Improved Whiskey Cocktail
2 bar-spoons of Gum Syrup
1 dash of Cura√ßao
1 Dash of Maraschino
1-2 dashes of Absinthe
2-4 Dashes Angostura Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Rye
Garnish with Flamed Orange Twist

1870's Old-Fashioned Cocktail
Sugar Cube soaked in Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Rye
Stir over ice
Garnish with Twist of Lemon or Orange

The Mid-Century Old-Fashioned
1 wedge of Orange
2 Maraschino Cherries
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Bourbon
2 Dashes Angostura Bitters
Muddle fruit and drink together
bury in cracked ice and stir

The Modern Old-Fashioned
~ .25 -or- 8 ml. Demerara Syrup
Two Dashes Angostura Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Bourbon
Stir over big ice
Garnish with Orange Twist

S-vsLXnNDRg,The Crazy Twists and Turns of Mark Twain‚Äôs Early Career - Drunk History,"Mark Twain started his writing career off by taking the powerful to task ‚Äì until the fateful day he overheard a tall tale at a bar.

About Drunk History: 
Based on the popular web series, Drunk History is the liquored-up narration of our nation's history. Host Derek Waters, along with an ever-changing cast of actors and comedians, travels across the country to present the rich tales that every city in this land has to offer. Booze helps bring out the truth. It's just that sometimes the truth is a little incoherent.

JoyZ8LVNjvU,"Kawhi Leonard grateful to have made history with the Raptors, talks free agency | 2019 NBA Finals","2019 NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard joins Scott Van Pelt to talk about the Toronto Raptors' win vs. the Golden State Warriors in the 2019 NBA Finals. He reflects on making history as he and his teammates bring the trophy back to Toronto, Canada for the first time in franchise history. He shares the advice he gives to his teammates, specifically in regards to the media attention that comes along with becoming a successful team, but he makes sure to stay humble when talking about his previous experience in the NBA Finals with the San Antonio Spurs and earning the 2014 NBA Finals MVP honors. Leonard is proud of the team that the Raptors have become, with ""no one butting heads"" to distract from the work on the hardwood and smiles as he talks about what it means to him to bring a trophy back to Jurassic Park and the fans in Toronto. He lastly touches upon free agency, saying he's taking it day-to-day and will take some time to enjoy the victory.

LANDISb6YhI,Hexe Kebekus auf dem Scheiterhaufen - BRANDNEUE STAFFEL Sketch History 2018 | ZDF,"Mehr Sketch History: http://ly.zdf.de/4CZ/

Carolin Kebekus brennt nicht nur f√ºr ihren Job, sondern auch f√ºr die neuen Folgen Sketch History.

Die Weltgeschichte ist eine verl√§ssliche Aneinanderreihung von peinlichen Missverst√§ndnissen, diplomatischen Fehlentscheidungen und grotesken Szenen sinnlosen Blutvergie√üens. Gen√ºgend Stoff als Steilvorlagen f√ºr die dritte Staffel.

Auch diesmal werden historische Ereignisse wild durcheinandergew√ºrfelt und durch skurrile Animationen und den bissigen Off-Kommentar von Geschi-Experte Bastian Pastewka verbunden. Sehen Sie, warum die Deutschen im Ersten Weltkrieg bei Verdun verloren haben, was wirklich zu Che Guevaras Tod im Dschungel gef√ºhrt hat und warum van Gogh sich sein Ohr abgeschnitten hat. 

Max Giermann, Matthias Matschke, Valerie Niehaus, Isabell Polak, Judith Richter, Alexander Schubert, Paul Sedlmeir, Holger Stockhaus und Carsten Strauch bilden das hochkar√§tige Ensemble. Gaststar dieser Folge ist Carolin Kebekus in ""Hexenverbrennung - das Musical"".",history

UwavMbo6Tew,"Eddie Rickenbacker&#39;s Raft, an Updated History Guy Episode","Known as the leading American air ace and most decorated U.S. soldier of the First World War, Eddie Rickenbacker required a different kind of courage when he and the crew of a B-17 had to ditch in the Pacific Ocean in October 1942. It is a harrowing story of survival at sea.

Originally produced in March 2018, I have since discovered quite a lot of extra footage of Rickenbacker that I did not have when the video was first produced, including footage of the rescue. Clips from the the USAAF training film ""Ditch and Live"" have also been included.

This is original content based on research by The History Guy. Images in the Public Domain are carefully selected and provide illustration.  As images of actual events are sometimes not available, images of similar objects and events are used for illustration. 

All events are portrayed in historical context and for educational purposes. No images or content are primarily intended to shock and disgust. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Non censuram.

Knockout is a spectacular ending to a boxing match. The competitor takes a blow, after which he is unable to continue the fight before the judge will count from 1 to 10.  The referee sees that the boxer was knocked out when he‚Äôs being disoriented or even goes unconscious. This means that the athlete lost the fight. The ability to knock someone out depends on the accuracy of the strike, the element of surprise, correct distribution of body weight, right technic and other factors. In this episode, I will show you the fastest knockouts in the world that are forever inscribed in the history of boxing.

What‚Äôs up Stitches!

There‚Äôs a great story to this video and it mostly starts with you.  We did a spin-off video called Flash In the Pan Hip-hop Conflicts of Nowadays featuring Ronald McDonald vs The Burger King.  You dug it but the verdict was clear that there should have been a Wendy‚Äôs cameo and that we should make the matchup a video for the main channel.  We also left out a few clutch disses in the lyrics (ahem) foot lettuce...and you helped us plug those holes.  So dope.   

So after much sizzle and preparation, have it your way.   See you next month.

U_ZpuGcV-I8,The Yankees-Red Sox rivalry hit a peak with Munson vs. Fisk | Beef History,"Thurman Munson and Carlton Fisk both played catcher at a time when the job required a lot of physical contact. They both excelled with a bat as well as behind the plate. They both led their teams to greatness (or at least really damn close, in the case of the 1975 Red Sox). 

And, for our purposes, they were both stupendously competitive. Their rivalry was driven by a relentless desire to be the best, and it's what the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry is at its very best.

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and went on to become one of the most influential, innovative, and successful groups in modern music, having sold more than 300 million albums worldwide. The band rose from the ashes of The Yardbirds, when Jimmy Page brought in John Bonham, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant to tour as The New Yardbirds. In 1969, Led Zeppelin released its self-titled debut which was produced by Page, as were all the subsequent albums. It marked the beginning of a 12-year reign, during which the group was widely considered to be the biggest and most innovative rock band in the world.

You'll learn about Franz Ferdinand, Gavrilo Pincep, the Black Hand, and why the Serbian nationalists wanted to kill the poor Archduke. You'll also learn who mobilized first and who exactly started the war. Sort of. Actually there's no good answer to who started the war, but we give it a shot anyway.

Agora (Spanish: √Ågora) is a 2009 Spanish English-language historical drama film directed by Alejandro Amen√°bar and written by Amen√°bar and Mateo Gil. The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.

The story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the agora, a gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman forum. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of The Rise and Fall of Alexandria (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.

Agora was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",history

7VOMFjQfJ8w,The Jesus of History versus the Christ of Faith,"Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history‚Äôs most influential and enigmatic figures by examining Jesus within the context of the times in which he lived: the age of zealotry. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against historical sources, Aslan describes a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity secret; and the seditious ‚ÄúKing of the Jews,‚Äù whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his lifetime. Aslan explores why the early Church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary and grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself.

VTc7jSFfRUU,ZDF-History: Promi Geschwister - Verdammt verwandt! Doku (2018),"Sie hei√üen Klitschko, Kennedy, Messner oder Tudor: Was sie eint, ist der Wille zu Macht und Erfolg. Doch w√§hrend die einen Seite an Seite f√ºr ihre Ziele k√§mpfen, stolpern die anderen √ºber Eifers√ºchteleien oder ihre Streitsucht, werden zu erbitterten Feinden.

Dass ein Streit unter Geschwistern sogar lebensgef√§hrlich sein kann, haben die Tudor-Schwestern Elisabeth und Mary eindrucksvoll unter Beweis gestellt. Die katholische und ""blutige Mary"" lie√ü nicht nur jede Menge Protestanten hinrichten, sondern verfolgte auch ihre verhasste Halbschwester Elisabeth, den ""Bastard"" von K√∂nig Heinrich VIII. und Anne Boleyn. Elisabeth landete im Tower und konnte nur mit einem Trick dem Schafott entkommen. Wenige Jahre sp√§ter, nach dem fr√ºhen Tod Marys I. von England, bestieg sie selbst den Thron und regierte England lange und erfolgreich. 

Reinhold Messner hingegen verliert seinen j√ºngeren Bruder durch ein tragisches Ungl√ºck. Von einer gemeinsamen Expedition im Himalaya kommt nur einer der Extrembergsteiger lebend zur√ºck. Die genauen Umst√§nde des Todes von G√ºnther Messner sind bis heute nicht gekl√§rt. 

John F. und Robert, die ber√ºhmtesten Br√ºder des Kennedy-Clans, teilen nicht nur die Leidenschaft f√ºr die Politik, sondern auch ihr tragisches Schicksal: Beide sterben bei einem Mordanschlag. ""ZDF-History"" erz√§hlt die Geschichten von ber√ºhmten Geschwister-Paaren, von denen manche nur den Namen, andere ihr ganzes Leben teilen.",history

t8d6xf1FwwU,Philippines Independence Day/Araw ng Kasarinlan - Flag of the Philippines History -,"The annual June 12 observance of Philippine‚Äôs Independence Day came into effect after past President Diosdado Macapagal signed the Republic Act No. 4166 regarding this matter on August 4, 1964.  This Act legalized the holiday, which is based on the Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898 by General Emilio Aguinaldo and Filipino revolutionary forces from the Spanish colonization.  The Philippines‚Äô flag was raised and its national anthem was played for the first time in 1898.  However, liberty was short-lived because Spain and the United States did not recognize the declaration.
The 1898 Treaty of Paris ended the war between Spain and the United States. Spain surrendered the entire archipelago comprising the Philippines to the United States.  The Philippines started a revolt against the United States in 1899 and achieved national sovereignty on July 4, 1946, through the Treaty of Manila.  Independence Day was officially observed on July 4 until the Republic Act No. 4166, which set out to move the holiday to June 12, was approved on August 4, 1964.",history

xy_M4pDjafo,Catholic Counter-Reformation: Crash Course European History #9,"When the Protestant Reformation broke out in Western Europe, the Catholic Church got the message, at least a little bit. Pope Paul III called a council to look into reforming some aspects of the Catholic Church and try to stem the tide of competing Christian sects popping up all over the place. The Council of Trent changed some aspects of the organization, but doubled down on a lot  of the practices that Martin Luther and other reformers had a problem with. Today you'll learn about the Council of Trent, the rise of the Jesuits, and Saint Teresa of Avila.

Now iOS is one of the world's most popular mobile operating systems despite only running on Apple‚Äôs own hardware. Compare this to the Android mobile operating system, which is licensed by Google to various hardware manufacturers and wireless carriers. Now the debate over which approach is better is a topic we‚Äôre not getting into today, because in this video, we‚Äôre going to focus on the history of iOS and its development from 2007 to 2018.",history

DoIQdQ9Mo5E,Lady Jane Grey (England&#39;s Forgotten Queen) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Lady Jane Grey became a Tudor Queen after the dying King Edward VI, the only son of Henry VIII left her the throne. Now, historian Helen Castor explores the tragic story of Lady Jane Grey and investigates how her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, was sealed as soon as she was drawn into the line of succession. 

In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.

This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.

The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.
Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.

Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.

B9YtgV7R4qs,History Channel - Civilization Lost - Full History Documentary,"Around the world, archaeologists are uncovering artifacts that suggest the existence of previously unknown ancient civilizations, much like the mythical city of Atlantis. 

There is a growing belief among certain scientists and archaeologists that tens of thousands of years ago, before the rise of today's man, sophisticated human societies populated large cities that possibly featured mechanized transportation, electricity, and advanced weapons systems. Proponents of this theory believe that these civilizations were wiped off the planet and that the evidence now lies buried miles beneath the Earth's surface. This two-hour special will investigate these beliefs and uncover the truth about people who lived before the beginning of recorded time.

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War as it unfolded in Asia. As John pointed out last week, the Cold War was occasionally hot, and a lot of that heat was generated in Asia. This is starting to sound weird with the hot/cold thing, so let's just say that the United States struggle against communist expansion escalated to full-blown, boots on the ground war in Korea and Vietnam. In both of these cases, the United States sent soldiers to intervene in civil wars that it looked like communists might win. That's a bit of a simplification, but John will explain it all to you.

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War, which was the decades long conflict between the USA and the USSR. The Cold War was called cold because of the lack of actual fighting, but this is inaccurate. There was plenty of fighting, from Korea to Viet Nam to Afghanistan, but we'll get into that stuff next week. This week we'll talk about how the Cold War started. In short it grew out of World War II. Basically, the Soviets occupied eastern Europe, and the US supported western Europe. This setup would spill across the world, with client states on both sides. It's all in the video. You should just watch it.

They came into contact with the Romans, who ruled the entire peninsula for over four centuries until the late 300s CE. They were replaced with various Germanic kingdoms, who were in turn replaced by the Islamic Caliphate. What followed was a gradual reconquest of the area, which had been completed by 1492. After a strengthening of the union of Castile and Aragon in 1516, Iberia took a form roughly similar to today.

Thanks to his mother's support, John Snow rose from humble beginnings as a coal miner's son and apprenticed to a doctor in Newcastle. As a young man, he treated many patients during the cholera epidemic that struck Newcastle. He noticed that the traditional explanation for cholera's spread - miasma from graveyards and swamps - could not explain its appearance in Newcastle where he treated patients. He took that knowledge with him to London, where he formally studied medicine and achieved the highest honors in his profession in only a year. His formal study of anesthesia earned him such great recognition that on two occasions he was trusted to work on the Queen. But then cholera broke out in London again. Snow wanted to prove miasma didn't cause it and find the real cause, so he interviewed patients and doctors across the city. He theorized that the diarrhea which came from cholera also helped to spread it. He even wrote up a case study where one street whose well water mixed with sewage had a huge infection rate while across the street their neighbors with pure well water barely suffered at all. Confident that he had found the cause, he published his findings, but the medical community was not thoroughly convinced.

In 1998, a website called NewGrounds allowed anyone to upload original cartoons to the internet. And those cartoons quickly took the internet by storm, even spreading to YouTube by the late 2000's. And 20 years later, in 2018, animation is still one of the biggest genres of online video. But the road here was not that easy. 
In today's episode of ""A Brief History"" we take a look at how online animation ruled the internet, was squashed by YouTube's algorithms, and bounced back stronger than ever!

It's been brought to my attention that I made two mistakes: 1) Yes, I disappear at 18:26. Not sure how that happened. 2) At 12:25 I use a map of Africa that with some weird borders. That's my bad. But if you look at a legit map of Africa, you'll see the same straight lines in the places that I marked them.
(Remember: making mistakes is ok, so long as we learn from them)

The Epic of Mwindo sure was cool, huh? This video is here to show you all about the lovely continent that it came from: Africa! And BOY are there a lot of misconceptions about it.

Note: The exact identity of the human species found at Happisburgh is a little more up in the air than this video makes it sound. Currently academic consensus looks to be moving towards Homo antecessor as the correct identity, however the stone tools found at Pakefield and Boxgrove are almost certainly from Homo heidelbergensis. This was simplified to Homo heidelbergensis in the video for the sake of brevity. Homo heidelbergensis may also have been ambush predators on top of scavengers and fishers.

Braveheart is a 1995 historical drama epic film directed by and starring Mel Gibson. Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The story is based on Blind Harry's epic poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.

The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, and Best Director.

Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film.[26] In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, ""Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.""[26] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), [27] there are large parts which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabelle).

Elizabeth Ewan describes Braveheart as a film which ""almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure"".[28] The ""brave heart"" refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, and an attribution by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, in his poem Heart of Bruce, to Sir James the Good Douglas: ""Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!"", prior to Douglas' demise at the Battle of Teba in Andalusia.[29] It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[30]

Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period ""no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind)."" Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not ""in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film"". She compares the inaccuracy to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.""[31] ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate‚Äîin short, just about nothing is accurate.""[32] The belted plaid (feileadh m√≥r l√©ine) was not introduced until the 16th century.[33] Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's ""farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early)."" [34]

In 2009, the film was second on a list of ""most historically inaccurate movies"" in The Times.[30] In the humorous non-fictional historiography An Utterly Impartial History of Britain (2007), author John O'Farrell notes that Braveheart could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a ""Plasticine dog"" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to William Wallace and Gromit.",history

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

In this landmark 4-part series Waldemar argues that the Dark Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world‚Äôs most famous collections and discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually an ‚ÄòAge of Light'.

psscbyQZxpU,The Biggest Scandals To Ever Hit The History Channel,"Back when the internet was young and facts still had meaning, there was the History Channel, featuring shows about - you guessed it - history. But that version of the network is long gone today. Here are the biggest scandals to hit the reality TV outlet that's now simply called History.
Ice Road Truckers is one of History's best-known reality shows, depicting the perilous lives of drivers in the iciest regions of Canada and Alaska. And sure, it's been criticized by actual trucker media like Truck News for exaggerating or even faking some of the danger.
But real scandal hit the show in 2013. According to a CBS report, star Tim Zickuhr abducted Lisa Cadeau after hiring her for escort work in Las Vegas. He claimed she overcharged him by $1,000 and demanded she meet him to settle the dispute. It was then that he dragged her back to his apartment, beat her, and tied her up in a closet.
Fearing for her life, Cadeau gave Zickuhr the phone number of an undercover police officer, claiming he could pay her ransom. Zickuhr called the number and unknowingly arranged his own arrest. The Las Vegas Sun reported Zickuhr confessed on the spot that he intended to hold Cadeau hostage and prostitute her through Craigslist.

John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance. Slavery as an institution is arguably the darkest part of America's history, and we're still dealing with its aftermath 150 years after it ended.

ebNO_1fnR0g,Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians in History,"Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians and Feminists in History

Lesbian relationship isn‚Äôt something that surprises people anymore. If couples have to hide even in 2017, what must it have been like a few years ago, when the LGBT community didn't understand their sexuality themselves? The LGBT community owes a lot to the men and women who came before them, knew how society felt about them, and yet, chose to love a member of the same sex openly.

10. Josephine Baker
Josephine Baker (1906 ‚Äì 1975) American-born French dancer, singer, and actor, was known by many monikers, such as the ‚ÄúBlack Pearl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBronze Venus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreole Goddess.‚Äù She was the first black woman to star in a major film, Zouzou. She married four times, and her adopted son Jean-Claude Baker describes his mother as a bisexual, and recalled his mother as having many ‚Äúlady lovers.‚Äù

9. Frida Kahlo
Frida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 ‚Äì 1954), was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. Much has been written about Kahlo, with her works being celerated by feminists for its depiction of the female experience and form. 

8. Amrita Sher-Gill
Amrita Sher-Gil (1913 ‚Äì1941) was an eminent Indian painter, sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo. Her affairs with men and women were quite well known, with her using some of them as models for her work. In fact, her work Two Women is considered to be a painting of herself with her lover Marie Louise.

7. Billie Jean King
Billie Jean King (born November 22, 1943) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She was the first prominent female athlete to reveal her sexuality, when details of her affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett, was made public.

6. Virginia Woolf
Adeline Virginia Woolf (1882 ‚Äì 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Woolf had a passionate relationship with Vita Sackville-West. This relationship inspired one of Woolf's most famous novels, Orlando , featuring the life of a poet who changes sex from man to woman over centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.

5. Audre Lorde
Audre Lorde (1934 ‚Äì 1992) was a black writer, feminist, womanist, and civil rights activist. She described herself as a ‚Äúblack, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,‚Äù and was known for her activist work with Afro-German women in the 1980s.

4. Barbara Gittings
Barbara Gittings (1932 ‚Äì 2007) was a prominent American activist for gay equality. Gittings served as the President of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, picketed the White House in the 1960s to let the world know how easily homosexuals could be fired simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.

3. Jane Addams
Jane Addams known as the ""mother"" of Social Work (1860 ‚Äì 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She co-founded Hull House in 1889 with her first romantic partner Ellen Gates Starr. Addams was later in a relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially sound, and supported Addams's work at Hull House. Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.

2. Queen Christina of Sweden
Christina (1626 ‚Äì 1689) reigned as Queen of Sweden from 1632 to 1654. Queen Christina rejected the role of a woman, which was simply to provide an heir, by announcing that she did not intend to marry. Modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, with many affairs with women noted during her life. 
Sources have found passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and she was supposed to have had relationships with Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira and the singer Angelina Giorgino.

1. Sappho
Sappho (c. 630 ‚Äì c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. The word ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù is literally derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, where Sappho was born. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Her poems spoke of the infatuations and love, both requited and unrequited, she felt for other women.

bO7FQsCcbD8,"The Constitution, the Articles, and Federalism: Crash Course US History #8","In which John Green teaches you about the United States Constitution. During and after the American Revolutionary War, the government of the new country operated under the Articles of Confederation. While these Articles got the young nation through its war with England, they weren't of much use when it came to running a country. So, the founding fathers decided try their hand at nation-building, and they created the Constitution of the United States, which you may remember as the one that says We The People at the top. John will tell you how the convention came together, some of the compromises that had to be made to pass this thing, and why it's very lucky that the framers installed a somewhat reasonable process for making changes to the thing. You'll learn about Shays' Rebellion, the Federalist Papers, the elite vs rabble dynamic of the houses of congress, and start to find out just what an anti-federalist is.

Corrections:

1.  Beirut is in Lebanon, not Syria.

2.  At the time of the Roman Empire, Great Britain would have been known as Britannia rather than England.  The name ""England"" was first used during the Middle Ages, referring to the tribe of Germanic Angles that settled the island after the fall of the Roman Empire.

3.  Our Lady of Guadalupe is the only Marian apparition in the Americas to have been approved by the Holy See.  Other Marian apparitions in the Americas have been approved by local ordinaries, including Our Lady of Good Success in Ecuador (1572),  Our Lady of Good Help in Wisconsin (1859), Our Lady of Cuapa in Nicaragua (1980), in Venezuela (1984) and Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolas in Argentina (1980s).

4.  At 2:06:35, the correct spelling is ""Hugh O'Flaherty"", not ""O'Flattery""",history

kcl98aBRkD8,The Unfortunate History of the AMC Pacer - Documentary Film,"Behind all the jokes and insults, the AMC Pacer is actually a car with a great deal of history.  It began as radical new design from an underdog company.  In an attempt to combat the big, bland, boxy cars from Detroit's ""Big Three,"" little American Motors Corporation decided to build something a little different.  Their one-eyed car stylist Dick Teague proposed a small, wide car with big windows and smooth aerodynamics.  Americans had never seen anything like it.
 This in-depth documentary tells the true story of the Pacer.  Unbeknownst to many, the car persevered through manufacturing setbacks, government regulations, and many other troubles.  Featuring a ton of old car advertisements and rare footage of AMC's factory, the film helps paint a picture of the Pacer's world.  Director Joe Ligo sits down with AMC stylist Vincent Geraci, author Patrick Foster, and television personalities John Davis and Pat Goss from PBS's MotorWeek.",history

One of the (few) ways that many of us can relate to the vast scope of history is from the visual angle. Research-based reconstructions certainly bring forth such an advantage with their provision of ‚Äòglimpses‚Äô into the past. And among them, facial reconstructions of actual historical characters rather notch it up a level, with their ability to tantalizingly satisfy our inherent curiosity about the ‚Äòplayers‚Äô in the grander scheme of things.

How long did it take you to make this video? 
Short answer: Too Bleeping Long (well over 100 hours as I had to remake this)
(I started in around December and research before then) 

What software/equipment did you use to make this video?
After effects, Illustrator, Premier Pro, Audacity, Yeti microphone, 

Believe it or not this is in a nutshell compared to the amount of research that went into this 
Obviously we've simplified some events just for the sake of time and missed people and events that can be covered in other videos

Do people still read? Eh if your reading this then yes.

JIMEK (Radzimir Dƒôbski), composer and producer.  JIMEK gained first international recognition when he was picked as the winner by Beyonc√© and judges such as Giorgio Moroder, Isabella 'the Machine' Summers, Afrojack in Beyonc√© 'End of Time' remix competition beating 3000 international contestants. The winning track was released on Beyonc√©'s next official release ""4: the Remix"".
He graduated with a degree in composition from the Chopin Music University in Warsaw and studied orchestration and film scoring at the University of California in Los Angeles. He started to work writing music for film and tv as a teenager, constantly building up his musical workshop and versatility, which led him to his love for stylistic liberty he calls 'smuggling'. Today his work ranges from writing and conducting contemporary symphonic pieces for philharmonics to producing completely electronic beats for collaborations and film.",history

How evil must you be to use your position of power to oppress innocent people? Take Pope Alexander VI.

But that‚Äôs nothing compared to someone like Idi Amin who massacred around 300,000 civilians. Then there are those terrorist leaders like Osama Bin Laden who ordered the execution of 9/11 and ordered his own men to sacrifice themselves in order to kill innocent lives.

*If you‚Äôre new to my music project: I‚Äôm Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. 

I believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light and precious soundtrack for you.

Many use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.

My music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.

Thank you for listening, liking and loving, sharing and commenting! Thank you for following and supporting my music project!

*I‚Äôm Michael and I love creating music. I play, compose and record mostly calm and peaceful tunes and started sharing these here on YouTube in 2011. 

Music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a meaningful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through a day, a phase, or through life. 
 
Many use my recordings and piano music sessions as background music while reading, doing mind work, to achieve better focus, while studying, while being creative, while coding or designing a product, a service or the world of tomorrow. From your comments I know that my music also works as relaxing music, spa or yoga music, or to set a calm tone at cafes, bars, lounges, in hotels and restaurants, mostly at a low volume.

This project is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my tunes, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally quite busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for a calm and peaceful, light and positive tune, the relaxdaily way.

Thank you for tuning in, for liking, sharing and commenting! Thank you for following and supporting what I do!

""India is special and its beauty absolutely humbled me. When we toured there as Major Lazer, it was mind blowing to see our fan-base and we wanted to incorporate the attitude and positive vibes into our video and just do something that embodies the essence of Major Lazer. Major Lazer has always been a culture mashup and to us, India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future. The experience is something we'll never forget.""

Lyrics:
[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Chorus: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Lyrics:

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this
You, you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don‚Äôt want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You‚Äôre so indecisive of what I‚Äôm saying
Don‚Äôt want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you‚Äôre down and then between

Ohh I really want to know‚Ä¶

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You‚Äôre overprotective when I‚Äôm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can‚Äôt win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won‚Äôt let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you‚Äôre down and then between
Ohh I really want to know‚Ä¶
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don‚Äôt want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind

Lyrics: 

I was walking down the street the other day
Trying to distract myself
But then I see your face
Ooh wait that‚Äôs someone else 

Trying to play it coy
Trying to make it disappear 
But just like the battle of troy
There‚Äôs nothing subtle here

In my room there‚Äôs a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity 
Even if it‚Äôs in my dreams

Ooh you‚Äôre taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

I‚Äôm trying
Not to think about you
No no no
Not to think about you
No no no

I‚Äôm trying
Not to give in to you
No no no
Not to give in to you

With my feelings on fire
Guess I‚Äôm a bad liar

I see how your attention builds
It‚Äôs like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear

What could possibly happen next
Can we focus on the love
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you‚Äôre the art I‚Äôll be the brush

And oh baby let‚Äôs make reality actuality a reality

Lyrics:

Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch youfixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again""

Use it as music while you're studying, reading, writing, while being creative or coding, day-dreaming, reviewing, or making future plans. This music mix, B-Sides N¬∞1, is a collection of 32 tracks that I created (composed and recorded) during the first 6 months of this relaxdaily project. 

Have a wonderful day!

*I‚Äôm Michael and I love creating music. I play, compose and record mostly calm and peaceful tunes and started sharing these here on YouTube in 2011. 

Music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a meaningful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through a day, a phase, or through life. 
 
Many use my recordings and piano music sessions as background music while reading, doing mind work, to achieve better focus, while studying, while being creative, while coding or designing a product, a service or the world of tomorrow. From your comments I know that my music also works as relaxing music, spa or yoga music, or to set a calm tone at cafes, bars, lounges, in hotels and restaurants, mostly at a low volume.

This project is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my tunes, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally quite busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for a calm and peaceful, light and positive tune, the relaxdaily way.

Thank you for tuning in, for liking, sharing and commenting! Thank you for following and supporting what I do! 

 - Michael a.k.a. relaxdaily

Lyrics:

I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

When a rich nigga want you
And yournigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see""",music

No fighting, no fighting

Como se llama (si), bonita (si), mi casa (si, Shakira Shakira), su casa

You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on

All the attraction, the tension

Lyrics:

She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Ohhhh oh oh oh oh
She got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Ohhhh oh oh oh oh
She got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire...
This girl is on fire...
She's walking on fire...
This girl is on fire...

Heeey heeeey heeeeey

Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight""

Lyrics:
One, one, one, one, one...

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in

Lyrics:

I guess I just lost my husband,
I don't know where he went,
So I'm gonna drink my money,
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope),
I got a brand new attitude and
I'm gonna wear it tonight,
I wanna get in trouble,
I wanna start a fight,

Na na na na na na na I wanna start a fight,
Na na na na na na na I wanna start a fight.

So, so what
I'm still a rock star,
I got my rock moves,
And I don't need you,
And guess what,
I'm having more fun,
And now that we're done,
I'm gonna show you tonight,
I'm alright,
I'm just fine,
And you're a tool,
So, so what,
I am a rock star,
I got my rock moves,
And I don't want you tonight""

LYRICS:
I am the son of rock'n'roll
I got the masses under my control
I like to drink, I love the dope
I want your money and I want your hope

Your money and your hope
Your money and your hope
Your money and your hope

Vaguely epic are my lyrics
Jealous folks are the only critics
Top of the world and I know why
The world is a pigsty

Son of Rock'n'Roll
Son of Rock'n'Roll
Son of Rock'n'Roll
Son of Rock'n'Roll

I am a bad motherfucker
Live long and well thanks to suckers 
Live long and well thanks to suckers 
I am a bad motherfucker

Gotta say thanks to rock'n'roll
It got me into a whole lotta holes
They hear my voice I touch their soul
Too bad my heart is a heart of coal 

And it don't matter none
If you make the juices run
the bank account will stun

I'm only here for myself
I've got a big fuck you for everybody else
Not only empty but empty and loud
I wonder if my father is proud

I am a bad motherfucker
Live long and well thanks to suckers 
Live long and well thanks to suckers 
I am a bad motherfucker

Get what you can, while you can and get out
Son of Rock'n'Roll

I am a bad motherfucker
Live long and well thanks to suckers 
Live long and well thanks to suckers 
I am a bad motherfucker",music

Lyrics:
[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Chorus: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Lyrics: 
Ahhh! Such a beautiful day
The sun‚Äôs shining in a beautiful way
gonna take a shower, brush my teeth and
Life is ultimately meaningless
....Uhh (cough)...

but I'll get out of the house
Get on the road, top down, hands out
Put on my favorite song and nod to the rhythm
The planet‚Äôs being destroyed by your carbon emissions

But I- I- , I‚Äôll head to class
try my best on every test til I pass
and my grades are screaming in my face - Ayyyy
98 percent of what you learn is a waste. 

I get to hang out with all my friends
My friends are the friendliest friends
Can't think of a better way to spend my time
Your brain is flawed and all your friends will die
Nevermind!

I‚Äôm alive in the greatest nation!
So proud of- the exploitation of natives
This graceful bird means freedom for all
Tell that to the slaves and bald eagles aren't bald

I can live in the moment, milk every second
at any time you could get clinical depression
But I'll just be happy, no matter what‚Äôs in store
it‚Äôs quite genetic and we have no cure 
uhh- at least

(CHORUS )
We are young 
not for long
Life is fun
It only goes downhill
We gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it 
or you'll regret it
We are young 
For now
Life is fun 
for some people
We gotta make the most of it, Make the most of it
Good luck

Woo! I got a brand new job today!
Doin stuff that'll help the economy
I'll save money and buy things at the store
Banks can crash and capitalism is flawed

And it‚Äôs all because of my hard work
And the thousand advantages you lucked into at birth
I put a lotta effort in my resume!
Good thing you don't have a black person‚Äôs name

I'm proud to be a functioning member of society
Finally, I can be the citizen I dream to be
part of the community, contribute with my tax
What could possibly stop me?
The shrinking middle class

I‚Äôve at least got a nice stable job
Until it‚Äôs outsourced to china or replaced by a robot
OH GOD- Well then I could relax a bit
You'll be empty with nothing to distract from it

But man I'm a passionate graduate 
I can be different and I have a career paths to pick from
I could be a rapper or an animator if I'm lucky
Neither of those will make you happy, trust me

I'm able to choose what I pursue
You're a slave to people born richer than you
Then screw it, I'll keep going in 
then I'll party on the weekend and sing

Thanks to autotune 

(CHORUS )

Life is a wonder
You‚Äôll never know the answer

Nature is a miracle
Natural disasters

It‚Äôs good to be alive
You could wake up with cancer

But I'm healthy
Healthy people still get cancer

I love this show
It‚Äôs the last episode

The sun is shining
It‚Äôs going to explode

Every species is beautiful and unique though
Children have malaria thanks to mosquitoes

I met a cute girl with a ponytail
Statistically that relationship is going to fail

I have a wonderful family, it‚Äôs like no other
You're not special and one day you'll bury your mother

No matter what I can find a home!
We. Will. All. Die. Alone.

There‚Äôs amazing potential in every human on earth
There‚Äôs no escaping the heat death of the universe

I don't have to live life based on negative parts
No matter how bad they are, they're just thoughts

Yeah that‚Äôs fair
wait really?
yeah that seems reasonable
wait-wait-wait-wait but you were just telling me
whatever man, I dunno, live your life how you want,
I'm not forcing you to do anything, I'm just saying.
Oh...Well in that case...

QrR_gm6RqCo,Mac Miller: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 6, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- There was a shift in Mac Miller's boisterous demeanor as he started the third of his three-song Tiny Desk set. It's the first time he's performed tracks from his new album, Swimming, in front of an audience. On ""2009,"" he rubbed his chin with clinched eyes, looking like a young man who's beginning to crack the code. Backed by a piano loop and a string quartet, he reflected on his journey's peaks and valleys thus far.

I ain't asking why no more
I know I'll take it if it's mine
I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

With nearly a decade under his belt at 26 years old, these words ring like an artist twice his age.

We were introduced to Mac Miller via 2011's XXL Freshman Class, which featured a special crop of MCs such as Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill and YG, all of whom are now considered in the upper echelon of hip-hop. After his big splash, he's been able to find a groove and consistently release quality rap records, ultimately keeping his name in the conversation with the other young greats. His 2011 album, Blue Slide Park, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the first independently distributed debut album to do so since 1995's Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound. These consecutive triumphs amassed plenty of fame, fortune and insurmountable obstacles, causing a stumble here and there. Throughout the years, however, Mac has brushed himself off and put it in the music.

For this performance, Mac Miller invited frequent collaborator Thundercat, who graced the Tiny Desk last year and will join Mac on tour this fall. Thundercat put on a dazzling shaker routine and played the deep centerpiece bass line on ""What's The Use?"" These Swimming iterations don't veer far away from the recorded versions, but here, his lyrics seem easier to interpret under live instrumentation.

Set List
""Small Worlds""
""What's the Use? (Feat. Thundercat)""
""2009""

Musicians
Mac Miller (Vocals), Thundercat (Bass), Justus West (Guitar), Klynik (Keys), Joe Cleveland (Bass), Kendall Lewis (Drums), Robin Fay-Massie (Violin), YaShauna Swan (2nd Violin), Lelia Walker (Viola), Melanie Hsu (Cello)

Lyrics:

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
Guess what he told me?
He said girl you better try to have fun 
No matter what you do, but he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you


Letras espa√±olas:

Han pasado siete horas y quince d√≠as
desde que te llevaste tu amor
Salgo todas las noches y duermo todo el d√≠a
Desde que te llevaste tu amor
Desde que te fuiste puedo hacer lo que quiero
Puedo ver a quien yo elija
Puedo ir a cenar en un restaurante de lujo
Pero nada
y digo, nada, me puede quitar esta melancol√¨a
Porque nada se compara, nada se compara a ti
He estado tan sola aqu√≠ sin ti
Como un p√°jaro sin una canci√≥n
Nada puede parar estas l√°grimas solitarias
Dime baby, donde me equivoqu√©
Podr√≠a poner mis brazos alrededor de cualquier chico que viera
Pero s√≥lo me recordar√≠an a ti
Fui al m√©dico y adivina que me dijo? Adivina que me dijo?
Dijo: chica, es mejor que ententes divertirte No importa lo que hagas, pero √©l es un tonto
Porque nada se compara, nada se compara a ti
Todas las flores que plantaste mama
En el patio trasero
Todas murieron cuando te fuiste
S√© que vivir contigo, baby, a veces fue dif√≠cil
pero estoy dispuesta a darle otra oportunidad
Nada se compara
Nada se compara a ti
Nada se compara
Nada se compara a ti
Nada se compara
Nada se compara a ti",music

When @bastilledan sent me happier for the first time I was taken back. The amount of emotion that you could feel in the lyrics was crazy. As I listened to the song more and more it reminded me of so many things I‚Äôve been through in my life. Toxic relationships, letting go of things I didn‚Äôt want to and just situations where happiness came with a sacrifice. Recently I lost my best friend, my companion, my life long friend. I wanted this video to embrace the pain that we feel losing or sacrificing something and the cycle of life that comes with it. I hope this song and video can bring closure in any situation you may be and make us all happier üíõ

Michael Jackson's 14-minute short film ""Thriller"" revolutionized the music video genre forever. Hailed as the greatest music video of all time by MTV, VH1, Rolling Stone and others, ""Thriller,"" directed by John Landis, is also the only music video selected to be included in the Library of Congress' prestigious National Film Registry.

Spotify - http://smarturl.it/mj_thriller25_sptfy?IQid=ytd.mj.thrill3  

Written by Rod Temperton
Produced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions
From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982
Released as a single January 23, 1984

THE SHORT FILM
Director: John Landis
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for ""Thriller"" was the third of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status (i.e.: sales in excess of 30 million) by the RIAA for US sales alone. The ""Thriller"" single reached No. 1 in four countries in 1984, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart as well as charts in Spain, France and Belgium. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Thriller the first album to feature seven Top 10 singles. The Recording Industry Association of America certified ""Thriller"" Gold and Platinum on December 4, 1989. 

The groundbreaking short films for the Thriller album, starting with ""Billie Jean,"" following up with ""Beat It"" and culminating with the epic, nearly 14-minute ""Thriller,"" truly expanded the possibilities of ""music video"" as art form. ""I wanted something that would glue you to the set, something you'd want to watch over and over,"" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. ""I wanted to be a pioneer in this relatively new medium and make the best short music movies we could make.""

In the short film's extended prologue, Michael's moonlit date with his girlfriend (played by model Ola Ray) is interrupted by his sudden transformation into a howling werewolf. While the ""real"" Michael and Ola, observing the scene in a movie theater, walk home from the their date, Michael teases her by singing the verses of ""Thriller.""

_pHT9yYFdZg,Wild Cherry-Play that funky music W/ lyrics,"Hey, do it now
Yeah, hey

Hey, Once I was a boogie singer playin' in a Rock and Roll Band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burnin' down one night stands
And everything around me, yeah
Got to stop to feelin' so low And I decided quickly (Yes I did)
To disco down and check out the show
Yeah, they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die
Oh ya, ya

I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish (How could I)
To not see I was the one behind
So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way
I said, I must go back there (I got to go back)
And check to see if things still the same
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, ya
Till you die

(Gonna play that electified funky music, yeah)

(Hey, wait a minute)
Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' Rock and Roll and minds and things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better (it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (no I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day
When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die
Oh' till you die

They shouted play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(You Gotta keep on playin' funky music)
Play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(Come and take you higher, ya)
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, ya
Play that funky music white boy

************************************************

Blinded by hate brought by the fall 
As I swear death to all
You will feel my vengeance
As I claim your mortal soul

I will punish and destroy 
Those responsible for this ploy
I will seek a thousand deaths
I will bring a thousand years of war

All that I had taken away
My home is gone, and my love ones slain
For every sleep claims a piece of me 
Every waking moment, every single dream

As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land 
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong, I was honor bound 
I stand defiant, I stand ever proud 
I am the chosen
I am the guardian, the guardian

Now I seek the blood of those 
Who claimed the innocent
I will hunt the enemy to the last
I will banish and rejoice
The final breath of foes
You will see what you have made 
You will see what I have finally become

All that I had laid to the waste
My spirit broken and just memories remain 
For every day claims a piece of me 
Every waking hour claims my inner peace 
My inner peace

As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land 
They laid siege to all we ever had
I stood strong, I was honor bound 
I stand defiant, I stand ever proud
I am the chosen
I am the guardian, the guardian

Dance to the Music, dance to the music
Dance to the Music, dance to the music
All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet
I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide
You might like to hear my organ
I said ride Sally ride
If I could hear the horns blow
Cynthia on the throne, yeah!
Cynthia and Jerry got a message that's sayin'
All the squares, go home!
Dance to the Music, dance to the music
Dance to the Music, dance to the music

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Maria (Julie Andrews) and the children ride throughout Austria singing ""Do-Re-Mi.""

FILM DESCRIPTION:
One of the most popular movie musicals of all time, The Sound of Music is based on the true story of the Trapp Family Singers. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood) sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl (Charmian Carr), who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness (Eleanor Parker). But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song ""Something Good."" Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the ""glories"" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

Featuring Nathan Barnatt as Officer Finkleman (https://www.youtube.com/barnatt)

Releasing a string of smash hits off his September 2014 debut album ‚ÄúPrayer‚Äù established Robin Schulz as one of the internationally most successful German artists of the past 20 years. Now, the Osnabr√ºck-native, superstar DJ and producer is set to release his highly-anticipated follow-up longplayer: Almost exactly one year after the release of his globally acclaimed breakthrough debut, Schulz is back on track with yet another stroke of genius: Promisingly entitled ‚ÄúSUGAR‚Äù, album no. 2 will be released later this year on September 18th!

Earlier this July, Schulz was awarded Triple Gold for his tremendous hit single ‚ÄúPrayer in C‚Äù, Platinum for ‚ÄúSun Goes Down (feat. Jasmine Thompson)‚Äù as well as Gold for his debut album ‚ÄúPrayer‚Äù in his home territory ‚Äì just 3 on a list of over 60(!) awards already amassed by the German deep house shooting star. In light of his upcoming new longplayer ‚ÄúSUGAR‚Äù, Robin Schulz is now about to take the next step in his amazingly successful career:

After his airplay #1 and global smash single ‚ÄúHeadlights‚Äù (feat. Ilsey) which delivered the first taste of his new album‚Äôs sound, the twentysomething is set to release the eponymous second single on July 17th: ‚ÄúSugar‚Äù, featuring 19-year-old Canadian singer Francesco Yates. Yates is widely considered the next big popstar in the making and his soulful falsetto vocals are quickly gaining praise by superstars such as Pharrell Williams or Justin Bieber. 

That being said, Schulz is more than likely to build on his peerless, record-breaking achievements of the past 18 months: Last year‚Äôs mega hit ‚ÄúPrayer in C‚Äù landed Robin Schulz the #1 spot on iTunes in 40 countries and topped the national singles charts in 17 countries, but that was just the beginning. His #1 remix of ‚ÄúWaves‚Äù earned him a Grammy nomination, while his Top 7 album ‚ÄúPrayer‚Äù received the German ECHO award for best ‚ÄúDance National‚Äù, in addition to a completely sold-out US tour. 

Today, Schulz remains the first German artist to attain the #1 spot in the global Shazam charts. He runs the most successful German YouTube music channel with a combined 330 million views, while generating downloads and streams in excess of nine figures. 

On the heels of his recent tour of the U.S., Canada, South Africa and Australia, Robin Schulz will be headlining major electro & dance festivals all over the world throughout the summer, such as Belgium‚Äôs Tomorrowland Festival.

Lyrics:
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‚ÄòCause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don‚Äôt make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don‚Äôt walk away
It‚Äôs in the palm of your hand now, baby
It‚Äôs a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

(Juicy J)
She‚Äôs a beast
I call her Karma
She‚Äôll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
‚ÄòCause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She‚Äôs sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She‚Äôll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I‚Äôm gon‚Äô put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don‚Äôt care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil‚Äô mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

Lyrics:

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass... bass... bass... bass

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places

I see the magazine workin' that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty, just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size
(Shoo wop wop, sha-ooh wop wop)
She says, Boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll
So if that what you're into, then go 'head and move along""",music

Lyrics: 
Once I was seven years old my mama told me, 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me, 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
‚ÄòCause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
‚ÄòCause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old my story got told 
I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold 
We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one 
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old

Lyrics:

Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head she sang

Come down
And waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how
You wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang""",music

Lyrics:

Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right

Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die

Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high.""",music

Official music video for Katy Perry's ""Roar"" brought to you in Junglescope directed by Grady Hall & Mark Kudsi and produced by Javier Jimenez, Danny Lockwood, Patrick Nugent, Derek Johnson and Oualid Mouaness.

Lyrics:
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ‚Äôcause I‚Äôve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
 
Louder, louder than a lion
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
You‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
 
Now I‚Äôm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ‚Äôcause I‚Äôve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar

Turn up the music cause the song just came on
Turn up the music if they try to turn us down
Turn up the music, can I hear it til the speakers blow
Turn up the music, fill your cup, and drink it down

If you're sexy and you know it, put yo hands up in the air
Put yo hands up in the air, girl put yo hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
If you're sexy and you know it, put yo hands up in the air
Put yo hands up in the air, girl put yo hands up and

Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)
Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)""",music

Lyrics:

Baby, can't you see
I'm calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm fallin'

There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm lovin' it

Too high
Can't come down
Losing my head
Spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know thatyou're toxic
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic",music

I am a composer from Norway and I started this channel with a simple vision: to create a place that you can visit whenever you want to sit down and relax. I compose music that can be labeled as for example: sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it. 

Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. All your warm support really inspires me to work even harder on my music. If you enjoy my work, I would be very happy if you decided to subscribe and join our community. Have a wonderful day or evening!

Jinx's dreams come alive in a hexplosive sequence packed with bombs and bullets and her unique take on fun. Marvel at the mayhem in the Jinx music video.

Vocals by: Agnete Kj√∏lsrud from the band Djerv. 
Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/get-jinxed

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Blah blah blablah.

[Verse 1]
Wanna join me, come and play.
But I might shoot you, in your face.
Bombs and bullets will, do the trick.
What we need here, is a little bit of panic!

Do you ever wanna catch me?
Right now I'm feeling ignored!
So can you try a little harder?
I'm really getting bored!

[Chorus]
Come on, shoot faster,
Just a little bit of energy!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!

Let's blow this city to ashes, 
And see what Pow-Pow thinks.
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause it'll get jinxed!

[Verse 2]
So much better, so much fun.
Let's start from scratch and, blow up the sun!

[Chorus]
Come on, shoot faster,
Just a little bit of energy!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!

Let's blow this city to ashes, 
And see what Pow-Pow thinks.
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause it'll get jinxed!

[End]
Come on!
Come on!
And get jinxed!

Somebody That I Used To Know - lyrics

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know

Somebody...

""""Billie Jean"""" was the first short film made for 'Thriller,' the biggest-selling album of all time. The short film for this No. 1 single, directed by Steve Barron, made history as the first video by a black artist to receive heavy rotation on MTV, and was later ranked by the network as one of the 100 greatest music videos of all time.

Written & Composed by Michael Jackson
Produced by Quincy Jones for Quincy Jones Productions
Co-Produced by Michael Jackson for MJJ Productions, Inc.
From the album Thriller, released November 30, 1982
Released as a single January 2, 1983

THE SHORT FILM
Director: Steve Barron
Primary Production Location: Los Angeles, California

Michael Jackson's short film for """"Billie Jean"""" was the first of three short films produced for recordings from Thriller, which continues its reign as the biggest selling album of all time with worldwide sales in excess of 105 million as of June 1, 2016 and in December, 2015 became the first ever album to be awarded triple diamond status by the RIAA for US sales alone. The """"Billie Jean"""" single reached No. 1 in 10 countries in the spring of 1983, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 - becoming the second-highest selling single in America that same year.

""""Billie Jean"""" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on April 4, 1983, and Platinum on February 4, 1989. The song won two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance - Male, as well as an American Music Award for Favorite Single - Pop/Rock and was also named the Single of the Year on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll in 1983.

The short film featured a paparazzo attempting to photograph Jackson as he danced through an urban landscape. A specially created set featured steps and sidewalk tiles that lit up underneath Michael's feet. It is here that fans first saw some of Michael's best-known dance moves, such as spinning and landing on his toes. Many of Michael's steps and mannerisms in the video would become forever associated with The King of Pop.

""""[W]hen the chorus hit.he sprung into this dance that was unlike anything I'd ever seen,"""" director Steve Barron recounted of Jackson's choreography in the video. """"It was just extraordinary, instinctive. He pulled it all together and turned it into what we saw.The camera literally steamed up, the eyepiece steamed up, because of my heat from what I was seeing."""" Barron also recalled the crew breaking into spontaneous applause after Michael finished dancing.

The """"Billie Jean"""" short film made history as the first video by a black artist to be played in heavy rotation on MTV, then in its second year. In 1992, the short film was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. MTV ranked """"Billie Jean"""" as the 35th greatest music video of all time in 1999, one of three entries of Jackson's on the chart alongside """"Thriller"""" and """"Beat It.""""

Shannon (born Brenda Shannon Greene,May 2, 1958) is an American singer. She is best known for her 1983 million-selling record, ""Let the Music Play"". The record re-defined the electro-funk sound that Arthur Baker and John Rocca (who produced ""I.O.U"" by Freeez) developed in 1982, which would eventually be called freestyle music.

In the spring of 1983, Greene was enrolled at York College and toured with the New York Jazz Ensemble. Quintin Hicks, an associate of the production team of Mark Liggett and Chris Barbosa, later saw Shannon singing with a live band in her cousin's recording studio. Shannon auditioned for Liggett and Barbosa with the song ""She Can't Love You Like I Do"". They introduced her to the track ""Fire and Ice"", which would later evolve into Shannon's signature song, ""Let the Music Play"". This title would also be applied to Shannon's debut album.

In July 1983, the ""Let the Music Play"" single was released and Shannon was invited back to record more songs with Liggett and Barbosa. The single reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Billboard""s United States R&B and Hot Dance and Club Play Chart chart. Today, it is ranked #23 among Billboard's best dance songs of all time.

Her debut album, Let the Music Play, was released in February 1984. The follow-up single from the album was ""Give Me Tonight"", which hit the top spot on the Hot Dance, Club Play and R&B chart. It also became a significant hit on Urban radio. It was one of Billboard's top 30 dance songs for the year 1985. In the U.S., the third single was ""My Heart's Divided"", another Latin freestyle track, featuring Jimmy Choo as one of the back up vocalists. ""Sweet Somebody"", a mid-tempo soul effort, made the Top 20 in Europe.

Let the Music Play went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Shannon was nominated for a Grammy and received numerous other awards, including the Dianah Washington (Jack the Rapper) Award, the Hall of Fame Award, the Gold Ampex Reel Award, a certified gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America, and the Best Billboard Top 10 female R&B vocalist.

In 1985, Shannon released her second album, Do You Wanna Get Away, which sported a sound similar to that of her debut album. The title track became her third #1 on the Dance charts and became her third hit on the Billboard Hot 100. She scored three more dance hits from the album, including ""Stronger Together"", a cover of ""Urgent"" by Foreigner, and ""Stop the Noise"", with a video sponsored by Pepsi and Black Angus. Her third album was 1986's Love Goes All the Way. This album was not as successful as her previous LPs. Shannon was Executive Producer against all odds.

Shannon asked to be released from her recording contract with Atlantic Records in 1987. She recorded soundtracks and jingles, Criminal"", for the movie Fatal Beauty and budweiser . While touring the world, Shannon attended and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.

In the late 1990s interest in Shannon rekindled, when VH1 spotlighted her on their One Hit Wonders series. Entertainment Tonight also taped a special about her life. In 1998, she co-wrote and sang on multi tracks produced by Todd Terri, Tony Moran, Germany's Sash Les Rythmes Digitales Les Rythmes Digitales

In 1999, Shannon released her fourth studio album, The Best Is Yet to Come, on which she is credited as 50% writer of the album (contracted by BMG). Chris Barbosa was invited back as a producer, along with Andy ""Panda"" Tripoli and Tony Moran. A greatest hits album was released in November 2004 without Shannon's knowledge and agreement.

On April 20, 2006, Shannon participated in the Freestyle Extranvaganza concert along with Judy Torres, George Lamond, Cynthia, Lisette Melendez, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, The Cover Girls, Hanson and Davis, Coro, and Stevie B.. The event was sponsored by WKTU, WSKQ, and WCAA in New York.

A fifth studio album, ""A Beauty Returns"", was released in 2007 without the knowledge and agreement of Shannon.

Today Shannon is a voting member of the Grammy's (Recording Academy) touring the world (Kuwait, Badghdad and Iraq) with the US Soldiers. She is also in the studio working on new hits for the year 2010.",music

This week i assembled the most gorgeous machined Aluminium Bearing Housings Made by Alexcnc from the MMX Team.
They are adjustable for the Depthing of the gears. We are also implementing the new PBS - Product Breakdown System for the Whole MMX. Chris, the new project manager has introduced me to the sacred lands of Excel heaven and although there is a lot of initial work we have to do to make this function properly, the long term efficiency will improve a lot! We are taking the MMX from being a one off DIY maker project to being a scalable, fully fledged - ready to build for any competent group of people - machine. Its really great! 

Enjoy and have a great day!

Lyrics:

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in twelve-thirty flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say: Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had""",music

MUSIC USAGE CONDITIONS:
Everyone is free to use my music if credits are given. Exceptions are if you want to use my music in something with commercial purpose because you can get into trouble with GEMA if there is no written permission from me, it already happened several times and people even got sued by GEMA without even my knowledge. So that's why you MUST request a written permission from me if your project is commercial, for your own safety. But as far as YouTube goes you can use my music for free even if you monetize your videos, just give credits and you can use any song you want. =)
